All we need are the files, and using `dl_manager.iter_archive(archive)` we have a generator that iterate over the files available within the tar file. "

      "The title suggests this was supposed to be in the same spirit as The Naked Gun, but the only similarity is Leslie Nielson. Drastically unfunny, even when it is technically bad. It drags like a rainy Boxing day. The sets are straight out of a 60's TV Sci-fi soap, the songs excruciatingly dull (and badly sung) and the the only suspense is how they got the money to make this low-point of Nielson's career.<br /><br />Go and see a good film, like Plan 9, or Robot Monster! If you want to see a good film in the same genre (and budget) try Dark Star. Its beach ball monster shames the rubber beast in this film right back to Toyo studios.\n",
      "I have seen many movies. More than a lot of people i like to think. And with this vast knowledge of cinema, I try to appreciate every movie i see, and even if it is \"bad\", and try to find some redeemable quality in it. Upon saying this, I believe, and this is quite a statement if you knew me, that the motion picture \"Spaceship\" is the worst film ever made in the history of time. There is not a word invented yet that describes how absolutely horrible this is. There are no redeemable qualities in it. This movie was not enjoyable one bit. I got sick a little bit during it. It is an embarrassment to film, to society, to humans as a race. However, it is imperitive that everyone watches this movie, so as to remind them that this is the bottom of the barrel, that this is as low as it gets. Like the holocaust, we must be reminded on how bad film can be and to NEVER let this kind of thing happen again. Make copies of this movie and send it to everyone you know. Lest we forget.\n",
      "I came into this expecting it to be bad. I had no idea how bad it was. The title suggested it might be in the Naked Gun/Airplane style of humor, which when it works is good, when it doesn't can be mildly amusing. I don't know what it was. <br /><br />It makes me wonder if the director had actually even seen a movie in his life. Perhaps it was an experiment to see what would happen if you took someone who had lived his whole life in a dark mildewy closet with only half a moldy, mildewy rat for a playmate, and set him loose behind a movie camera.<br /><br />Actually, 90 minutes of watching someone sitting in a dark mildewy closet, playing with a dismembered moldy mildewy rat would be more entertaining than this piece of garbage.\n",
      "This film is so utterly horrible that it defies description.<br /><br />Leslie Neilson does a great stony-faced captain, Patrick Macnee is almost good as a mad scientist (as the box claims him to be). In fact, the actors all actually do a fairly good job.<br /><br />So what is wrong with this piece of garbage?<br /><br />I guess it boils down to the script. The concept of a couple of musical numbers is cute, but they don't work. The special effects don't work. The fact that you can see the concrete floor of the studio doesn't work. The space ship models are so reprehensibly bad that they don't work.<br /><br />The movie just doesn't work.<br /><br />I remember the first time I saw the box for this DVD at Best Buy. They wanted $20. I read the box, saw the cast, and a cold shiver clutched my bowels. I _knew_ this was a horrible film.<br /><br />But time passed, and I came upon a copy for $5 at a used book store and I should have passed on it. Instead I wasted 90 minutes of my life and whatever time it's taking me to write this warning, sorry, review.<br /><br />I'll end with this: at the end of the credits you find out it was made in 1983 at a community college.<br /><br />It shows.\n",
      "This is a prime candidate for worst 'comedy' film ever made.<br /><br />They came close to screwing up; there were a couple moments where I almost cracked a smile",
      "almost. I have a friend who loves this film. His wife and I are considering having him committed to a sanitarium for just that reason. Neither of us can see what makes this film so amusing to him. At the same time, he can't see the entertainment value of \"The Beyond\" or \"Dellamorte Dellamore\" (aka Cemetery Man), two popular cult films. <br /><br />What's wrong with \"Naked Space\"? It's not funny; it's uproariously unfunny. The attempts at jokes all fall flat. They even attempt an ill-advised musical number. They say that 'drama is easy, comedy is hard'. This is a textbook example of how badly a comedy film can fail.<br /><br />The DVD I saw this on was where it was re-titled and called \"Naked Space\" in an attempt to capitalize on the popularity of Leslie Nielsen in the entertaining movie parody series \"The Naked Gun\" (based on the old \"Police Squad!\" TV series). The idea of this film was to parody old B grade sci-fi creature movies on obviously cheaply made sets. Even \"The Seventh Planet\", in all its awfulness, did a better job of that while probably attempting to be somewhat serious sci-fi.<br /><br />Bruce Kimmel has never directed a good movie and probably never will. He helped write the story for Robert Rodriguez's \"The Faculty\", but it was simply a B grade sci-fi horror film idea that was made into a good film by Rodriguez's direction and a decent cast.<br /><br />Leslie Nielsen can be very funny in parodies of a variety of film genres. This is not one of those movies. I rate this film only slightly higher than complete failures like such bad Z grade zombie films as \"Day of the Dead 2: Contagium\" and \"Dead Life\". The only reason to watch this film is because you lost a bet (and that should put anyone off of gambling). One could be excused for thinking that the cast members appear in this film because they lost a bet with Kimmel.<br /><br />Run, do not walk, away from your nearest video store to avoid this movie!\n",
      "Leslie Nielsen and Patrick Macnee? How could they go so wrong? I've gone out of my way to watch really bad films, and in their own way they're often entertaining. This was painful.<br /><br />Nonexistent plot, spun out for 75 minutes. Little discernible attempt at humour - and believe me I'm the target audience for spoof space film references.<br /><br />There must be an amazing backstory to this film - good cast, but they clearly didn't want to be on that awful set in that forsaken community college. Perhaps this is in fact the funniest film ever - and the joke's on all the viewers who sit through it.\n",
      "Flat, forgettable parody of \"Alien\" about small spaceship crew who land on newly discovered planet, bring back a tiny blob of grape jelly that mutates into a one-eyed, humanoid grape jelly thing that sings \"I want to eat your face\" and then proceeds to show the crew that he means what he sings.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this is not in the same vein as the \"Naked Gun\" / \"Airplane!\" brand of parody movie-making, where the verbal and visual gags are almost non-stop. This movie seems to be aiming to be just silly. The jokes just die most of the time, and despite the efforts of a cast (including Leslie Nielsen, now a veteran of this kind of thing) that tries hard, the material just doesn't work. Writer / director / songwriter / co-star Bruce Kimmel (who had previously worked with co-star Cindy Williams in 1976's \"The First Nudie Musical\") gives it just a little bit of curiosity value with a few musical numbers (his songs actually ARE kind of catchy), but the film is ultimately lacking in real wit and basically has no energy. The lack of a big budget is hilariously obvious.<br /><br />Despite Nielsen's presence, I actually thought that stalwart Brit thespian Patrick MacNee was the comic standout - he was amusingly loony. Gerrit Graham hams it up a lot as a sort of standard issue lewd, crude jerk character that you sometimes find in straight-faced films of this kind.<br /><br />I wouldn't go so far as to say that I hated this film - it's not crummy enough to provoke that strong an emotion, and after all, it IS supposed to be a no-brainer comedy, but I just didn't it find to be very entertaining. If you really want to watch Nielsen act goofy, watch \"Airplane!\" or \"The Naked Gun\" and you'll be better off.<br /><br />3/10\n",
      "I think every movie deserves a chance but! The Creature wasnt nice does not deserve even one minute of the 90 plus minutes of my life I wasted watching this piece of space waste!!!!!!!! My friend bought this attempt at a movie for $6 dollars Canadian at walmart I think that with todays exchange rate thats less than a dollar American.\n",
      "Oh, what can I say about this movie. I only watched half an hour, and it was the worst I've ever seen. The movie has been re-sold because of Leslie Nielsen's success with Naked Gun, but this movie is very bad. - I feel sorry of Leslie Nielsen, but this movie deserves 1/10, the budget must have been very small.\n",
      "Ok. I do respect movies. At least I always do what I can to see films also from other point of views.<br /><br />BUT.<br /><br />This is not a movie. It's really a piece of crap. Actually I myself have made better films than this one. I guess the point in this was to make a funny film, but actually nobody in the film crew or actors were interested about it.<br /><br />I got the feeling that the camera men (if there even were any) were asleep behind the camera. Directing is something .. yes and music and graphics too. Actors couldn't care less about anything. Leslie Nielsen is infact the only guy even trying to do something of it, but I guess he stopped trying at some point.<br /><br />Wait.<br /><br />I remember some laughters.. Yes, when the keycode of a door made some familiar beeps and the other one was when Nielsen was evasing asteroids or something. But that's it. The rest wasn't even entertaining.<br /><br />So everybody should cut the crap about \"This is the worst movie I've ever seen\". They actually haven't seen any movies if they say something like that about modern movies. To them I'll have to say: see this.<br /><br />Actually the funniest thing was that the cover said that this film was released in 1994 and also that: After \"Naked Guns\" and \"Spy Hard\" Leslie Nielsen takes you to the funniest space trip you have ever experienced.<br /><br />Geez. Do these guys ever watch what's in there...\n",
      "In 'RV' Robin Williams plays Bob Munro, a business executive who is trying to get in touch with his family. Problem is, he is not cool anymore and is out of touch. Suddenly, he has to the family vacation plans from Hawaii to Colorado; else he could lose his job. So the idea is rent an RV and go driving, and that is where the fun begins.<br /><br />It is refreshing to see Robin Williams back in the comedy seat. He is truly the life of this film. Unfortunately, he is probably the only funny one in the movie. I can not say it was that good; it is like 'Family Vacation' meets 'Cheaper by the Dozen 2'. Not entirely original, but there are some fun moments with the RV.<br /><br />I did like the Gornickes (Jeff Daniels and Kristin Chenoweth), they were a little too unbelievable, but they did have a good report with Robin Williams. I think both Robin Williams and Jeff Daniels should do more projects together.\n",
      "I won't say it was the worst movie ever, but this was written for the REAL, REAL simple to enjoy. If you've not watched TV sitcoms or any other movie in the past 30 years, you'll find this movie refreshing and original (has anyone seen National Lampoon's Vacation?). The theme (middle aged dad loses touch with his family and sets out on a trip to unite them, with calamity at every turn), has been done almost annually in Hollywood in one form or another. I won't criticize the movie for it's potty jokes or lack of insightful humor, or groan-inducing one-liners, but I will pan it for it's 100% lack of any originality. Especially the self-serving last 15 minutes which were a cookie-cutter version of any \"life-realization\" moment, with our hero delivering his big speech to his business colleagues (and, of course, his money-only-minded boss) where he chastises them for being all about business and not LOVE and family.....puke-inducing, patronizing, and done-before to exhaustion. Complete with family grouped together in the corner in a perfect photo-op portrait pose, this speech can be seen coming for miles. Guess what? He ends up quitting his job, BUT the other guys (Ben and Jerry-type hippie jillionaires)in attendance from the other company want to hire him on the spot for sharing their vision of a world where business doesn't do business....it makes LOVE grow. I have to go toss my cookies now.\n",
      "Let me just say that I love Robin Williams. I've gone to his stand up shows, seen almost all of his movies, but this movie just didn't do it (for me). It tried very hard to be funny, but ended up being cheesy and predictable. I think I laughed at one thing, and I can't even remember what it was. I was excited to see GOB and Buster from Arrested Development in it, but that just made me sad that they took off a TV show that actually knew how to deliver comedy. Anyways, if you have little kids, they'll probably love it. If on the other hand you are the select few who enjoy laughing at The Office (UK) and Arrested Development, you probably won't like it.\n",
      "Robin Williams is like a spastic chipmunk with Tourette's syndrome. It's a complete shame that a wide release of a turd like this equals box office success. All members of the cast must have received their money on the dresser as the producers left the hotel room. I can't believe Robin Willims could be more unfunny. He makes Robert Kline look like George Carlin. Robin has replaced Jerry Lewis as the person who is most out of touch with what is funny. On the plus side, I believe the French will be unveiling a croissant for Robin on their walk of fame. Is Cheryl Hines really this desperate to work in movies. The only thing that could make this movie worse would be if Paris Hilton would show up and try to be dramatic and then she would be consoled by Wanda Cykes wearing a thong and looking for a Brazillian wax. This movie is not only a complete waste of time and theater space, it would have been an improvement if they just ran the trailers on a continuous loop for 90 minutes.\n",
      "everything that happens to this family, they deserve. the whole fact that they learnt a lesson is supposed to be a resolution at the end of the film. you have a man who is too wimpy to tell his boss he won't write a report when he's supposed to be going on holiday. employment laws are on his side, he is allowed holiday. his boss can't threaten his job the way he does, so that conflict would never arise.<br /><br />he hires an RV and is given no instruction as to it's various functions and has not been asked if he has ever driven anything like it? that I find unlikely.<br /><br />their trip to his business meeting is of course plagued with problems, all of which they fully deserve.<br /><br />Even the way they treat the other campers who try to be friendly with them is excessive.<br /><br />robin williams is supposed to be the main comedy name carrying this film but none of the situations he is put in are funny.<br /><br />The seatbelt gag is stupid. there are tribes in the amazon who have never seen cars that would have worked out a seatbelt faster. the fact they insult us by trying the same gag twice?<br /><br />he deserves to lose his laptop and is an idiot. he clearly should have said no to his boss when he asked him to do this report and just gone to hawaii and saved us the trouble of this terrible and contrived movie.<br /><br />best avoided.\n",
      "This movie is a bad ripoff of \"The Long Trailer\" and was a really sad attempt at humor. I am trying to remember the last entertaining movie I saw with Robin in it, maybe \"Goodwill Hunting\" or something back in that era. I am beginning to think he is just trying to finish out some contractual obligation because I honestly can't see where his heart was in it. Or else he just sucks these days because this movie stinks. The raccoon gag was completely idiotic and his kids make me hope Global Warming hurries up.<br /><br />RV stands for Really Vacant of anything approaching comedy. Remorsefully Vapid, Ridiculous Vortex of stupidity, or Repulsively Vacuous.\n",
      "I'm 15, I watched this movie with my younger brother (11). Please keep this is mind when reading this review.<br /><br />This film is extremely cliché (SPOILER SPOILER ---workaholic father realises he does not know his family so hires an RV to go on the road with his \"hardcore\" son, sarcastic teenage daughter and \"perfect\" wife. Disaster of course, ensues, they meet a \"madcap\" family and try to avoid them but fail and after a lot of chaos eventually manage to become best friends and LOVE is returned!)SPOILER OVER.<br /><br />We rented this movie as we believed it would be light hearted, clean family humour. It is actually probably the grossest movie in history.<br /><br />The majority of the sentences refer to \"crap\" \"poop\" \"t*rd\" or \"sh!t\" and there is one particularly disgusting scene in which the Father (Robin Williams, this movie's selling point) gets sprayed in the stuff. It was then my brother said \"Turn it off! Its gross and not even funny!\" but, believed it would get better we carried on.<br /><br />Direction was OK, plot was cliché, SOME STEREOTYPICAL acting was good (the \"odd\" family parents and the younger son) albeit \"Jojo\" whose sarcastic teenager whose lines left me saying \"What?\". This film is ideal for a 6-9 aged audience as only that audience would appreciate its toilet humour and supposed \"hilarious\" scenes.<br /><br />If you consider \"RV\" funny, please compare with \"Little Miss Sunshine\" and realise what a \"rolling t*rd\" (which the family lovingly christen the RV) of a movie this is! <br /><br />My Brothers comment? : Just DON'T watch \"RV\".\n",
      "For a Robin Williams vehicle this is pretty slow. There are few humorous scenes, very few. In fact this movie has been done before. Replace Robin Williams with Chevy Chase and change the RV to a Truckster and you have \"Vacation\". The desert scenes are very reminiscent of Vacation. Sitting here trying to think of funny scenes and its almost impossible. THe scene where the kids realize they are going on an RV vacation rather than Hawaii, no. The scene where the RV crashes into the lake and Williams goes in and comes out on a bicycle..nope. Really there is very little to recommend about this movie. I don't have a lot to say about this movie really except boring, poor acting, annoying complaining kids, stupid RV tricks. The one redeeming quality about this movie is Jeff Daniels. No matter what that guy acts in, from Dumb and Dumber to Gettysburg to George Washington and everything in between, the guy is an acting genius. If you like Jeff Daniels, go see this movie. If not, then don't waste your money. It will be on late night cable in about 4 months.\n",
      "This is perhaps the driest performance I have ever seen from Robin Williams.I might have smiled and almost chuckled a time or two,but this film never once made me laugh.Humor that involves raw sewage just isn't very entertaining to me.As a matter of fact(and I say this with no pun intended),it stinks.I have always thought that Robin Williams is at his best when he is improving,and it just seems here that he was not given enough room to do this.It seems like he is going a little too much by the script.It may not be his worst film ever,but it certainly ranks closer to the bottom of the list than it does to the top of it.I recommend all movie goers steer clear of RV and take another road.\n",
      "Simply put, not even Robin Williams could make this movie funny. If you do decide to go out and see this, it shouldn't be for it's alleged humor, but for the sad but true depiction of today's modern family. A good movie to compare this to would be Christmas with the Krank's, both of which deliver the same amount of stale jokes, and no character development. At no point during the movie did I even chuckle. I am not kidding when I say that I did not laugh the whole time I was there, it almost felt down right stupid. And Coming from a guy who laughs at incredibly stupid commercials this should mean something. I feel cheated out of my money and time. So don't take any chances. Sit down with your family, order a pizza, and rent a copy of National Lampoon's Vacation instead. Trust me on this one.\n",
      "Anyone associated with this movie should be subjected to one of two following punishments: Be stuck in a cave for 50 years and be forced to exist on small troglodytic mammals and insects; or Be forced to watch this movie over and over for 24 hours.<br /><br />I would rather choose the first of these.<br /><br />It is hard to imagine how this movie could be made and then released onto humanity. It will forever become the fifth horseman of the apocalypse. Death, famine, war, pestilence and RV will ride on that day of world ending.<br /><br />Shock and awe. I cannot even begin to describe the feelings of waste that I feel for dropping $4 on it for a rental. Now, I would rather have paid $4 to have not seen it.<br /><br />Poor Robin Williams...to drop to this level. I feel nothing but shame and sorrow for such a great performer.<br /><br />I am aghast.\n",
      "This movie was OK, not that funny, Josh Hutcherson did a TERRIBLE job, some of the jokes (including R.V. sewage line) were EXTREMELY unnecessary. Not very good direction. Really annoying singing. GOD it was just really kind of dumb. The ending was just plain dumb, \"Dad, the R.V.'s rolling away!\" Gosh.<br /><br />I know they weren't trying to make \"Schindler's List\" or anything, but still the worst family comedy since \"The Shaggy Dog.' The ending reminded me of \"The Pink Panther\" which also had a terrible ending. One of the things that really annoyed me was the PG. Sometimes i thought it should of been PG-13 (but of course a very mild one.) Pink panther was definitely better. Similar jokes, worse plot, worse acting etc. 4/10. Rent this one.\n",
      "This movie should have been released on DVD first because its only worth a one day rental. Robin Williams is very bad in this flick - so is the director (who has seen better days). I could have written a much better and clever script. I guess producers think: lets take Sonnenfeld and a dd a bit Robin Williams - and voilà: we have a hit!<br /><br />The story is predictable so are the actors. One has the feeling to have seen this or that scene in another movie already. For example: National Lampoon's Vacation on the other side was fresh and gaudy for the days it was shot. Everyone remembers that film. I spun off several sequels. Who would think that this poor movie would spin off anything. Let alone Robin Williams, I guess he would rather have his name removed from the credit. He has seen better days.<br /><br />Well, this movie stinks and I am sorry for every cent and dime I paid to see it.\n",
      "Robin Williams didn't outdo himself in RV. Instead, he used the same old tired failure and called this a movie. It was not a movie. It is garbage. I wouldn't waste my money to see it again if I knew before how sorry it was. <br /><br />Obligagatory Note: Robin Williams did excel at two things in this garbage:<br /><br />(1). Robin Williams sucked royally (2). Robin Williams made reference to Karl Marx and<br /><br />Communism like it is a good thing. This garbage had a weak plot, weak characters and it couldn't even be called slap-stick comedy. It was certainly not clever and original.\n",
      "Loved the gritty/real Manhattan / New York City scenes  somewhat like Law and Order or NYPD Blue. The sharp picture quality on the DVD was much better than if I had watched this show originally on a 1961 television. Many top-flight actors made guest appearances, and Paul Burke, the star of the show and who later appeared in Dynasty, was great. Watched several episodes from 1961 on one DVD: The Fault In Our Stars (a pretty good classic detective story), Take and Put (a funny farce), Make Believe Man (too \"dark\" a story  didn't watch much of it). Stories remind me somewhat of Twilight Zone. Since Twilight Zone isn't really my cup of tea, probably won't rent any more episodes.\n",
      "Damn! This movie totally ruined my very own self-invented little theory stating that all cult/exploitation movies with the number \"2000\" are incredibly cool. You know, for example, obscure post-apocalyptic cult flicks like \"Holocaust 2000\", \"Escape 2000\" and \"Death Race 2000\" were tremendous fun to watch, so I was fairly confident that this one would be cool too, especially since the title refers to a type of heavy machine gun. Wrong again, of course, as \"Equalizer 2000\" is a gigantic yawner of a B-movie without any sort of suspense, coherence or ingenuity. This movie actually just is a non-stop 90 minutes lasting series of deafening shootouts, explosions and car chases. Now, this may very well sound like the ideal description for a cheap 80's B-movie, but trust me, the complete lack of a plot gets boring very fast. You know you're in trouble when watching a film of which the acting sequences are so dull that you start spotting the errors in geography instead. \"Equalizer 2000\" is supposedly set after the nuclear winter; in a time were the snowy grounds of Alaska turned into unbearably hot deserts. The intro states there isn't any type of vegetation on our planet any more, yet a couple of sequences later the characters are playing cat- and-mouse right next to a crystal clear lake surrounded with beautifully green plants. The story is really, really basic. The post-nuclear world is divided in small independent communities that are all rebelling against (and attempting to steal oil from) the powerful \"Ownership\". After they killed his father, former mercenary of the Ownership Slade flees into the desert and joins one of the rebel communities. There, he works on the Equalizer 2000, the most powerful gun in the world and the only weapon that can put a stop to all the rivalry and gang wars. \"Equalizer 2000\" literally just jumps from one overlong shootout scene towards the other, but we don't have a clue about who is fighting against who or why exactly. The battle sequences are also very unexciting and dire, without cruel violence or harsh bloodshed. They're just chaotic scenes in which a bunch of losers  that don't even bother to seek any cover  aim at each other and occasionally one falls down. Lead actor Richard Norton, a poor man's Chuck Norris, luckily doesn't speak too much because he's one of the most wooden actors I've ever seen. His love interest is Corinne Wahl, a stunningly ravishing girl with a fabulous rack and a tight leather pants, but the idiot only has eyes for the stupid titular gun! There's an early role for Robert Patrick as a sleazy independent gun smuggler. Boring, pitiable and infuriating waste of time; avoid like hell!\n",
      "Here's an entirely undistinguished post apocalyptic yarn from the normally reliable Cirio H Santiago.<br /><br />Dashing martial arts star Richard Norton has very little to do here other than run around with a souped up gun, alternatively shooting and blowing things up. Yes, if you like gun fire and explosions then this may well be blissful viewing but for those requisite of a bit more substance to their viewing this will prove a decidedly tedious watch.<br /><br />Not wishing to stray from the main point of my review, but one thing that never ceases to irritate me about some of the reviews on IMDb is the swift tendency by many reviewers to label every single low budget flick as 'The greatest B-movie ever!'. OK, so I admit that tastes vary and it's very much a subjective issue but really  before awarding any such lofty accolade, do so with at least some perspective and knowledge of the genre to which the relevant film belongs. The film in question for instance is anything but a classic in any way, shape or form.<br /><br />In fact the only reason I can think to watch this other than for Norton completists is to a) see the always superb Robert Patrick in an early role and b) to see the very beautiful (and buxom!) Corinne Wahl as the films heroine.<br /><br />For a far more enjoyable Mad Max/Road Warrior inspired outing try instead some of the Italian entries in the genre which are infinitely more memorable and indeed so much more fun than this.\n",
      "This movie really sucks, but still it´s fun to watch. For 90 minutes it´s just gunfights and explosions. No talking, just shooting. It´s amazing to see fully grown men act like this, and being serious about it! If you have nothing to do on a late Sunday night, then give this one a try!\n",
      "If there is one thing I appreciate about director Cirio H. Santiago, it's that he seems to like strong female characters and includes them in many of his films. In \"Equalizer 2000\" we have the sexy Corinne Wahl, who handles her guns with proficiency and adds the only spice to the film. The lead is Richard Norton, whose (considerable, if you watch any of his HK work) talents are largely wasted in a few poorly filmed fights, and who is a total blank as a character (more the script's fault than his own). The action scenes are uninteresting and unexciting - chaotic battles between armies of anonymous people whom we don't know or care about. There is just very little worth seeing in this film, and almost all of it comes from Wahl. Even with her, however, your best option is to skip it. (*)\n",
      "This movie was from an acting, production and plot standpoint awful. The movie is set in a post apocalyptic earth where oil is a natural resource is fought over by tribes of humans. The main character Slade dislikes the \"evil empire\" the Ownership, who controls most of the ownership. Through a random plot twist Slade joins Corrine Wahl's tribe and manages to build a 6 barreled super gun that shoots lasers and grenades and weird disks and all sorts of cool stuff. Of course the Ownership wants this gun, and tries to steal it. I'll let you figure the end out.<br /><br />I think that this might have one of the lowest production values of any movie I have ever seen. The entire movie is shot in primarily two locations in one canyon. As far as props they asked every actor to bring their own props. About 3 people have matching outfits, while the rest are just hodgepodges of random stuff spray painted silver to try to be more consistent. The buildings are poorly made shacks from random building materials actors had. As for the weapons everyone asked their 5 year old for his toy gun, and brought it to work. If they didn't have kids they just used PCP pipe.<br /><br />However the complete junkiness of everything, above average fight scenes and terrible acting makes this movie enjoyable. Although the plot was extremely simplistic it kept me gripped, and I actually wanted to finish the movie, which is more than i can say about a lot of movies with quality similar to this one.\n",

HISS!!!) who want to use poor Tobor for their own evil purposes.<br /><br />A movie that was way behind its time-even for 1954.<br /><br />If you want a real classic boy-and-his-robot-friend story, check out IRON GIANT, BICENTENNIAL MAN, or even MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000, for that matter.<br /><br />Rating: * out of *****\n",
      "Beautiful model in New York has to decide between two marriage-minded suitors--unfortunately, the one she decides on turns out to be a jealous psychotic, turning her back into the arms of the first boyfriend. They marry and move to California, but the jilted, delusional maniac is close on their trail. TV-made stalker-drama from producer Aaron Spelling was ahead of its time in terms of subject matter, however the story is creepy and pointless. Lesley Warren works herself into a real tizzy worrying that new hubby Ryan O'Neal won't be able to protect them from crazy Peter Haskell, though apparently Ryan has been working out at the gym behind her back (resulting in an evening street brawl which fails to raise any concern from the neighbors). The finale is directed for melodramatic chills, rendering the potentially gripping plot dynamics mute. One can easily see why up-and-coming star O'Neal signed on for this movie: he gets to be the sensitive good guy while also protecting his helpless wife from the scary villain. His performance isn't bad--and Haskell is careful not to overdo the wild-eyed bit--yet the picture takes mere surface-swipes at its own possibilities. It was designed to be a paranoia thriller for housewives, and as such is a callow, forgettable enterprise.\n",
      "I have to think that I am so out of step with the masses. What can others be seeing that I missed. I will say that in the restroom after the movie the other women were laughing at the movie and shaking their heads in disbelief of the hype. There will be many spoilers below. First of all, the acting was fine...that's about all the good I could see. The screen play was illogical. Why would Russell Crow's character continually miss opportunities to escape and the good guys continually miss opportunities to kill the bad guys? Why would they sit around a roaring fire in Apache territory and why wouldn't the Apaches just kill them as they most certainly would have? Why would Russell Crow's character kill all his guys who risked life and limb for him? Why would the writer put a stupid schtick in a chase scene where one character throws an explosive and another character shoots the explosive in mid air while riding full out on a horse? Why would the mine team just stand there and wait to be shot by men they knew to be psycho killers? Why would Russell Crow risk his life jumping over roofs just trying to get to the train? Why would the good guys miss the opportunity to shoot the bad guys in the street with a perfect shot from the bridal suite? How did Peter Fonda recover completely in a 24 hour period after being gut shot? How did Russell Crow's mouth heal completely after being beaten unmercifully by Peter Fonda? Why was Russell Crow's hands handcuffed in front and not in the back? I could go on and on, but I've already wasted enough time and money on this complete mess of a movie.\n",
      "Here is an undeniable truth of movie reviewers: When you really want to promote a movie that's not that good, talk about the great performances of the actors. Then you can praise the movie to high heaven, feel you have done your penance, and content yourself with the ingenuity of your expansive insights. This is the case with 3:10 to Yuma.<br /><br />So, what's wrong with this movie? Well, let's just look at the last 20 or so minutes of the film: <br /><br />1. Apparently the bartender/hotel clerk in Contention, AZ, whom we've not been introduced to until this point in the movie, is in cahoots with the bad guys because he make a point of surreptitiously and eagerly directing the bad guys to the location of the incarcerated Mr. Crowe. Why does he do this? Who knows. The filmmaker never lets us in on the secret.<br /><br />2. Apparently the Neanderthal menfolk of Contention, AZ, are a simple-minded lot who, at the thought of earning $200.00 by murdering the the folks holding murderous Russell Crowe in custody, just can't wait to start throwing lead. \"Mabel, Whar's mah raffle? Ahm gonna keel me sum law-men an geet myselves $200.00 dollah cash on that thar barrelhead!\" <br /><br />3. Apparently no one in Contention has a problem with watching their unarmed police force viciously gunned down in broad daylight. After this atrocity, folks continue to wander the streets, go in and out of stores, and continue their daily lives as though nothing has happened. Except for, of course, the menfolk who are hiding in wait for a chance to earn that $200.00.<br /><br />4. Apparently no one bothers to theorize that when you are firing dozens of rounds of ammunition at two men who are as close together as they can be without being Siamese twins you just might hit the guy you're trying to rescue.<br /><br />5. Apparently, when Russell Crowe's psychotic gunslinging hero-worshiping gang member finally realizes the implications of the above, he figures he better start shootin' them menfolk he'd promised that thar munny to. Of course, none of the surviving menfolk think to start shooting at him.<br /><br />6. Apparently--well, you get the idea. In other words, this excuse for movie-making is, quite frankly, stupid! In order to take this seriously, you must convince yourself that the type of behavior exhibited by many of the characters in this film is the way people really act. Whether it be the above examples, or Peter Fonda being shot in the stomach, at close range, having the bullet removed, and then immediately riding out into the desert on horseback as though nothing had ever happened to him, much of this film is just plain ludicrous! By the way, I'm no gun expert, but I do know this: If you are shot in the stomach at close range you ain't gonna be going' nowhere and you certainly ain't gonna be trottin' around on a horse! <br /><br />The bigger problem with this movie is its message, which is this: People who do the right thing because it's the right thing to do are fools. Good people don't thrive. As Christian Bale says, \"I've been asking God to help me for three years and he hasn't done it yet.\" For those who would attempt to live a righteous, honorable life there is nothing but despair and hopelessness. In fact, at the end of the movie the true hero of the piece is the psychopathic, vicious, murdering Russell Crowe character. And, by the way, this film does NOT retain the ending of the original, so if you were hoping it would, forget about that.<br /><br />If you see this film, you might recognize material from other Westerns. You have an iron clad stagecoach, reminiscent of John Wayne's \"War Wagon,\" quotes from the Bible, reminiscent of Randolph Scott in \"Ride the High Country,\" the psychological bantering between the Crowe and Christian Bale characters, reminiscent of not only \"Ride the High Country\" but also of \"The Tall T\", an Elmore Leonard story with Randolph Scott and Richard Boone, and Christian Bales's cursing teenage son, reminiscent of Ron Howard in John Wayne's \"The Shootist.\" <br /><br />Your better bets: All of the other movies I named above plus the original with Glen Ford and Van Heflin.\n",
      "Okay, first why steal the title from a classic western if not just to yank a few more bucks from their clients (us) when the so-called remake is butchered beyond belief. This effort should have been a standalone production just so it wouldn't drag down another production with it.<br /><br />The main character played by Crow is quite happy to murder law enforcement and his own gang members with nothing shorter than that of a psychopath yet fluctuates back and forth in wanting to help and feel sorry for his captor and son. I won't waste time repeating a lot of the films other irregularities, but that run through town with the citizens and gang now trying to kill them, I mean let's get real. Was it a town policy only to sell guns to blind people? And were the town people who were after the money, who knew every nook and cranny of their tiny town, just terminally stupid as well?<br /><br />As for the last scene - total in its absolute ridiculousness. Crow was a psychopath. Someone unable to empathize with any worth extended to others, so what's with the aw shucks I guess he's not so bad after all when he's been murdering those after him and his own gang all throughout the whole story.<br /><br />I could go on, but I'll leave it with this. If this is the best the studios can do with Westerns then they should forget about making them. This movie wasn't even worth the time wasted making or watching it even if you got to watch it for free. I like the main actors, I like Westerns, but the potential for quality that these things offered was absolutely absent here.\n",
      "Somehow a great Western story with solid actors and beautiful sets gets tainted by Austin Powers antics. All we need is Scott Evil to point out to us how Russell Crowe's character Ben Wade is going to escape AGAIN! I mean I get it. It's a movie, but boy, that guy Dan Evans with the wooden leg can motor.And PLEASE, someone tell me how the amulet or lucky charm engraved in the gun handle or carried by Dan empowers them all to mystically pause then, as Dr. Laura would say, \"Now go do the right thing!\" <br /><br />Yuma ends in something so contrived it's laughable. You know they say movies are made for an eight grade educated audience and even with grade inflation no one in middle school will be insulted by this film.<br /><br />All the killing was great. I mean I love bullets, especially the ones fired at point blank that don't blow the guts out of Peter Fonda's character. Was he wearing body armor or is he just so old and leathery that it stops the molten hot projectile from penetrating his subcutaneous fat and peritoneum. Pretty soon he's 'good to go' and up in the saddle and fighting Ben. And when he gets flung over the cliff his posse pales show great restraint. \"OK Mr. Wade, that'll be enough, now get back on your horse, we have a train to catch.\" <br /><br />When Butch in Butch Cassidy gets mad at his gang but only kicks the big guy in the nuts. Crowe does Butch one better by blowing them all to pieces. A nice parting gesture after they ride 80 hard miles to rescue him. The very last icing on the cake was Roy Roger's horse Trigger doing a cameo and responding to a whistle from Crowe. <br /><br />If you loved this movie don't watch, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, Unforgiven, Open Range or Dances with Wolves.<br /><br />Filmmakers: PLEASE SOMEONE SAVE THE WESTERN!\n",
      "This is a stinker of the Nth order. Nothing in this movie rings true. From the moment when the McElroy character played by Peter Fonda is shot POINT BLANK in the stomach, and not only doesn't die, but lives on to lead the posse after cold-turkey surgery THE SAME DAY, this movie lost me. From then on, all I see are its flaws.<br /><br />They are countless.<br /><br />The story is muddled and confused. There is dialog that uses contemporary vernacular. The end is SO COMPLETELY unbelievable that it isn't even worth spoiling for you all.<br /><br />Smells like the old West, though. Like fresh road apples or cow pie.<br /><br />In short, this was a remake that should never have seen the light of day. James Mangold, director, clearly let everything get away from him, as he did in Walk The Line, a movie that ended up being a really bad film vehicle for Ocsar nominees, but started out being a really good biography of Johnny Cash that NEVER DELIVERED.<br /><br />Miss this train! The 3:10 to Yuma is garbage.\n",
      "I sure got suckered into wasting time and money to see this turkey. If you like the Arnold Schwarzenegger genre of movies you would like this one. Russell Crowe plays Arnold. It's full of violence, cruelty, lies, treachery, profanity, sex and, worst of all, improbability. The good guys can't even deter the bad guys with a Gatling gun but one lone Mexican sharpshooter shooting from \"miles\" away, fells the good guys. When the bad guys see the good guys with a Gatling Gun they just laugh because they know the good guys can't hit the broadside of a barn with anything. The good guys can't even hit a horse with their Gatling Gun! And Ben Wade, the toughest, smartest, most ruthless outlaw of all times, remains in town, in a hotel room with a girl, with his horse tied up outside the bar until the Sheriff and his men ride back into town and easily take him into custody. (He has to be taken into custody early on in the movie in order to start this parody of getting him on the 3:10 to Yuma!) In one scene, toward the end, the gang offers the townspeople a $200 per person bounty on the Sheriff and each of the good guys and the townspeople go crazy in their desire to make $200 or more. And, in the end, Ben Wade, who, himself, or through his gang, has dispatched everybody who matters to their eternal rewards, is so impressed with the truth and courage of the opposition, that he voluntarily gets on the train to go back to the Yuma Prison for his third time and, most likely, to a date with the hangman. And then along the way there's some mention of the Bible, some Bible verses, and then some sort of cross or crucifix on Ben's gun handle. Yep, it's SOME movie. Recommend it to your friends who may have steered you to a similarly stupid flick or some friends that you would like to hear less from.\n",
      "Well, I can look at all the outrageous contradictions, bad cgi explosions/scope effect/fake town effect/cloud effect, etc, numskulled goofs and sheer idiotic behavior from characters in the film, and idiotic continuity from film makers, except a few. The script writer, continuity supervisor, and director should all have been fired. 3:10 to Yuma (2007) is an insult to a film viewer's intelligence.<br /><br />The gang, who does'nt seem capable enough to shoot anyone very well, is so dumb that they can't stop a slow stage coach? An armored coach (+3000 lbs), complete with a Gatling gun (+1000 lb) in the back (film for teen action fans)? Yeah right, it would weigh a ton so the horses could not pull it for long, plus the Gatling gun could not be fired while moving. Easy way to stop a slow stage coach, just shoot two horses. Wow, yeah, it's that easy folks.<br /><br />Fonda (aside from his hideous acting) takes a .44 slug to the gut and rides out of it, then he rides out the next day without bleeding to death? Dumb dead white guys left on rocks, left by Apaches in front of their \"camp area\" so that everyone knows they (Apaches) live there. Not too smart script writer. Dumb white guys camp with an open fire in Apache country and live? Apaches, using rifles, are shooting in pure darkness, wearing \"war paint\" and traditional feather caps, while not moving around to disguise their location? It was also an insult to portray the Apaches as \"cold blooded killers\" while they were fighting for their tradition, family and lives.<br /><br />For one, they would not use guns. They would wait, then surprise the camp (who was trespassing on their sacred land), and use arrows and knives. This was truly laughable and degrading to Apache skills as warriors. Wade, in cuffs, in pure darkness, guts 3 Apaches??? A stack of TNT is tossed in the air, then easily blown up by lead bits from shotgun, thereby causing extensive damage to a very secure \"open\" drilled tunnel that is very sound. This was truly laughable.<br /><br />The last scene, which is badly edited (notice people walking about during gun battle, then gone in next scene, snow on ground in a drought season, etc), was absurd. A one legged man with a shotgun outruns everyone (thanks to shaky camera), then stops in the open to unfasten the train door and gets shot in the back? Well yeah, there was a gun battle 2 minutes previous. This was truly laughable.<br /><br />3:10 to Yuma (2007) is an insult to a film viewer's intelligence, especially the insane ending where Wade shoots up his own gang who was attempting to free him. That tops the heap the most. It is degrading. For one, it doesn't prove Wade was \"moral\", just a schizo because he's yapping about escaping in the hotel a few minutes earlier.<br /><br />The script writer has little in the way of intelligent reasoning.\n",
      "This movie is terrible. One of the most important qualities that makes a movie good or not is whether the story, characters and plots are believable and realistic based upon what we know of the story.<br /><br />Christian Bale and Russell Crowe are two phenomenal actors and I'm surprised they signed on for such a pathetic script.<br /><br />How many times did Russell Crowe almost get away? They just kept giving him chance after chance after chance. These guys were not idiots. He was cold blooded killer. The way to transport him is to tie him up, gag him, and lead his horse for him. Not give him every chance to escape that they could.<br /><br />And CB sitting RC at his dinner table to eat dinner with him family!!! C'mon, how cheesy is that. The guy can't be trusted and he knows it. Has he got rocks in his head. Sit him in a corner or in another room, with a gun to his head and then give him food.<br /><br />All throughout the movie they treat him like he's their buddy, not their prisoner. It's poorly done. Letting him sit in the window of the hotel in Yuma and talk to his gang! That's ridiculous! This movie is poorly, poorly done and I was very disappointed in paying money to see it.\n",
      "In the first and most memorable scene in this movie, 'Jackson', while wearing a hockey mask and meandering around the streets of London one night, and grabs a guy from behind and peels back the flesh from his face and then punches a hole into the guy's chest and then rips out his heart. Then, in the first of several changes in tone, we get annoying attempts at humour, where Jackson tries on cowboy hats in a store while still wearing his hockey mask, a cornball sequence where they go for a stroll on the beach one evening at sunset, while Jackson is still wearing his hockey mask(!) - is this supposed to be a comedy or a soap opera love story now? The movie changes tone drastically (again) and we plod through over a half an hour of crap about him and his blind girlfriend and their relationship problems, with Jackson walking around their bedroom wearing a pair of red underwear with 'Bad Boy' printed on them. *groan* Then if I remember correctly, towards the end we get a couple more semi gory killings, before Jackson collapses crying and screaming \"No! No! No!\" after seeing a marquee at a local movie theatre which reads something to the effect of \"Coming soon: 'Unmasked part 26'\" hinting that he still will never be able to stop killing, no matter how much he may want to, because the producers will keep bringing him back again and again in more sequels.<br /><br />That joke about the marquee listing the title of the next supposed sequel being called 'Unmasked part 26' probably didn't make sense in the alternate version called 'Hand of Death' either, and it does make for a really anticlimactic (and abrupt) ending. This looks like home movies filmed on the streets in and around London on a pocket change budget in a few days time, while it might have had a valid point about the unoriginality of Hollywood, it was mostly brought down by the non existent budget and the dramatic changes in tone throughout the movie. It just ends up looking like a hybrid between horror, soap opera romance, and the kind of diffused look of a soft core porno video. It's one of the most memorable flicks you're ever going to see, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's good.<br /><br />** out of ****\n",
      "It was probably a funny idea at one time to spoof the Friday the 13th films by making Jason a nebbish man full of self-doubt. The fact is that the FT13th films are unintentionally funny on their own, this film tries to be more satirical and the whole thing collapses under its own intentions. The gore is even grosser than most FT13th films, and the violence is rather cruel, especially the final murder. There are no funny lines here, or suspense, just another case where the special effects budget was more than the screenplay budget. Pass the hockey mask and give this a 1.\n",
      "Like I said in my previous review of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie, this movie is horrid. However, unlike the original, I could not find a single thing worth laughing about in this movie. This movie is a disgrace. It hurt my eyes. In the middle of the movie I turned on my CD player and listened to Lucinda Williams. LUCINDA WILLIAMS FOR CRYING OUT LOUD! I LISTENED TO \"RIGHTEOUSLY\". RIGHTEOUSLY, FOR CRYING OUT LOUD! I started asking myself what had happened to the spunk, the interest of the bad guys that was with Ivan Ooze in the original. Why am I closing my ears whenever the Power Rangers speak? Why don't I just chop the film up and scatter its pieces into the wind in defiance of the piece of crap I rented? (Well, actually that's the reason I didn't harm it.) I wish I could forget this experience. But you don't forget a headache like that any time soon, do you?\n",
      "First of all, Power rangers are themselves bad but this is unbelievable. The first movie should appeal to children under the age of 8 and had one decent villain followed by the worst $0.02 CGI transformation sequence in the history of mankind. However, compared to this, that movie seems like the Godfather. Nothing will make sense if for some unfortunate reason you find yourself watching this. It is pure and utter garbage and is'nt funny no matter how you try to look at it. Its disgusting. Its not a movie. Its not a show. Its guano. Most people wont watch it anyway so why am I wasting time writing this? I don't know. The only thing I don't understand is why this is'nt in the bottom 20 list? Make that bottom 5.\n",
      "Just another bad sequel to a great movie. A Power Ranger fan's worst nightmare, which isn't really saying much so to speak. This really kills the MPG franchise. Why wasn't Billy in this one?, Why wasn't Jason the Gold Ranger? And what happened to The Machine Empire? There's nothing in this movie but very weak plot but that's about it! Even the series to this movie was lousy! To say the least! All though I liked Power Rangers in Space but the following Power Rangers series like Lost Galaxy,Light Speed Rescue,Time Force,Ninja Storm,Wild Force,Dino Force and S.P.D. where pretty crappy! Watch Voltron The Third Demention instead. Don't waste your time or money watching this disappointing no film! It just ain't worth it.\n",
      "I am probably one of the minority of intelligent teens who liked the first movie (even though I have just turned 18).<br /><br />So I watched the second one and I have to say it was as terrible as a sequel can get. They used CARS. That might have been great for any other movie but seriously, making the Turbo Zords CARS? That's something I cannot believe.<br /><br />The movie concerns the Power rangers saving a wizard called Loriglot from evil being Divatox. And there were no fights. basically, it was a very disappointing movie. The only good point was the return of Kimberley. And the climax was exciting (albeit really really stupid)<br /><br />Other than that, stay away from this film at all costs.\n",
      "I was completely disgusted by this movie. It is just another example of how they butchered what used to be a great tv show. I loved the first movie, but this one is so horrible, you couldn't pay me to sit through it. The story line was dreadfully cheesy, the acting was worse than usual, and the \"special effects\" were definitely something to be laughed at. Take my advice, and don't waste your time.\n",
      "Saw it once at 9-10 years old did not care for it although I was syked when I heard Jason (Austin St. John) the original Red Ranger and the greatest ranger of all time period! Saw it again yesterday and same thing did not care for it. It looks like the TV show the effects which for a movie of this supposed magnitude should have rocked the house with the then new improved CGI instead looked like LASER FLOYD anyone remember that one neither do I. The plot is really thin and the spoilers are given away almost immediately with the trailers and interviews the only part with the Turbo Megazord was too short 5 mins and face it if there was no zords the show would not have lasted as long as it did or less than that MMPR: the movie's Ninja Megazord had at least 15-20 mins of screen time and had impressive CGI at least at that time it did. The major baddie Mali...something was not threatening at all MMPR had more impressive monsters than this rubberized reject but I give it a four because of a hinted romance between Jason and Kimberly I mean who goes out with a girl solo and still be just friends plus they acted a little too friendly around each other flirting and whatnot and were hardly seen without each other and only fraternizing with each other if that doesn't say love I don't know what does. Even though we get the big three of power rangers I mean everyone knows these guys Jason (the compassionate leader) Kimberly (The heart of the team and she's pretty damn hot) and Tommy (the favorite and pretty boy of the group) the character development well face it there was none plummets this from movie to one overlong action kiddie show. I also give it a four because out goes Rocky Jason's replacement and the most annoying of the original MMMPR and then Blue Zeo Ranger YES!!!!! and enter Justin the other immensely annoying Blue Ranger NOOOOOO!!!!! All in all the return of Jason and Kimberly couldn't save this one from the pointless action sequences thin plot and annoying character of Justin it was better off with a direct to video release even Die Hard fans may want to steer clear of this one\n",
      "I remember reading the Roger Ebert review for the first Power Rangers movie and above all else he hated the fact that the Rangers were, essentially, color coded clones with only thin streotypes as personalities. Well, I'm dying to know what he thought of this entry. It emphasises Ebert's point in the scene where a little kid who was allowed to stand in for an injured Ranger gets the magic armor on... and in the dissolve, we see him replaced with an adult sized armored stuntperson.<br /><br />I'm what kids consider a cool adult. I don't hate boy bands, I can name all the Pokemon, and I enjoyed the first season of \"Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers\" as I'd enjoy an old Godzilla flick. This movie was when I started to get a tad disillusioned with them.\n",
      "This is the movie that turned me off from power rangers. I really dont like how the kid, justin, is the blue ranger. it needs to be a teenager. however i did like the Cameo of Kimberly (pink ranger number 1) and Jason (red ranger number 1)thought it to be really cool that they still acknowledged that they were a part of this story. Needs to be a reunion Special or something of the Classic Power Rangers. it would so make me Happy. but other than that there are several problem i have with the movie Justin is just not a convincible power ranger. The Villians arent the greatest either. Ivan Ooze was so much more villianous in Power Rangers the movie. Of the 2 power ranger movies, this one comes in second. if Justin wasnt the blue ranger maybe id change my mind\n",
      "I hated this movie so much i destroyed my friends tape, i only watched ten minutes of it and blew it up. I hated the t.v show's,this movie, and the memorabilia. the t.v shows got old the movie was gay and the memorabilia was like pokemon cards.\n",
      "Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie (1997) <br /><br />Starring: Johnny Yong Bosch, Nakia Burrise, Jason David Frank, Catherine Sutherland, Amy Jo Johnson, Steve Cardenas, Austin St. John, Blake Foster <br /><br />Directed by: David Winning, Shuki Levy <br /><br />Plot outline: The Power Rangers must protect an alien creature from a villain that wants to release a great evil imprisoned on an island.<br /><br />My thoughts: I really don't like this movie, first off, it's not a movie, it's more like a 90 minute episode of the TV show, as a matter of fact, that's what the movie should have been, a 3 part season premiere, second problem: the title, why is it called Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie and not just Power Rangers: Turbo just like the show, also, why isn't this a sequel to the first film?, I mean, come on, can't you just at least make a more proper sequel, I know this was after most of the original cast left, but dang, also, the special effects were worser than the effects in the first one, they look like something a nerd would do on After Effects, the Justin kid was so annoying, he's not even worthy of being the Blue Ranger, the Lerigot character angered me, he looks like a cross between an Ewok and a troll baby doll, the villains are dumb, however, I did like the soundtrack, and there a few decent action scenes, but that's it.<br /><br />Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie should have stayed on the IMDb bottom 100 list, 1.5/10.\n",
      "I was eleven years old when this second Power Rangers movie came out. I know some fans had gone off the Rangers by the time they were that age, but I didn't mature as fast as them. So, I was still a big fan when this film came out (I was even still a big fan a year later), and remember watching it over and over for a while. Now, believe me, if I didn't see it then, I would NOT have bothered watching it ten years later, but because of the wonderful memories, I decided to do so. Obviously, it wasn't the same.<br /><br />Divatox, an evil alien pirate, plans to go to the island of Muranthias on Earth, where she intends to release an evil creature named Maligore and marry him. In order to do this, she will need Lerigot, a good wizard, so she plans to have him kidnapped! Fortunately, the wizard manages to escape to Earth, seeking help. Tommy and Katherine go to find him in Africa, and teleport him back to the command centre. However, Lerigot soon decides to surrender after it is learned that Divatox has captured his wife and child! After this, the evil space pirate and her crew head toward the island, and it's obviously up to the Power Rangers to try and stop her, but before they set out, Zordon and Alpha 5 give them new powers called \"Turbo powers\"! <br /><br />Where do I start in describing this movie? Well, first of all, there are some pretty poor quality characters. I would say the worst is probably Divatox, who was the Rangers' main enemy in the \"Power Rangers Turbo\" series. She basically acts like a bratty kid, and it seems her antics are supposed to be funny, but at an adult's perspective, they're quite embarrassing. Hilary Shepard puts on a VERY poor performance in this role! Nobody in the cast is very impressive, but most of them do a better job than her! Another character who brings the movie down in quality a bit is Justin, the new Blue Ranger, who is a lot younger than the rest. He's certainly not the only character with lame lines, but it seems his are often worse than most of the others. None of the characters stand out as really good, but clearly, some do stand out as remarkably bad.<br /><br />As you can probably tell from the above paragraph, this movie has a poor script, and the acting generally isn't so good. If you're an adult who is at all familiar with Power Rangers, I'm sure none of this surprises you. Now, sometimes when a movie is bad, it can be unintentionally funny. A few months ago, I watched \"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie\" (which I had never seen before), and around the beginning, I found that it was mildly amusing, but was disappointed to find that the amusement soon went away. Watching this movie after that one, I was hoping for some more unintentional humour, but didn't really find any of that, apart from the scene where the Power Rangers have just gotten their new Turbo powers, and say things like \"This is great!\" (with a thumbs up) and \"This is awesome!\" As a straight male, there's one thing I got out of this movie that I wouldn't have when I was eleven, which was the looks/physique of certain female actors, including Nakia Burrise and Catherine Sutherland who play Tanya and Katherine (the two female Rangers of the time), and I guess even Hilary Shepard who plays the dreadful main villain, but this obviously didn't make the entire film for me.<br /><br />Now, I must admit that watching \"Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie\" again after all these years wasn't quite the same as watching \"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie\" for the first time earlier this year. It didn't seem QUITE as bad, even though it's generally considered inferior to its predecessor. In fact, call me crazy, but I found that some parts weren't too bad at all, though I wouldn't say I exactly enjoyed the movie. However, I guess the fact that I actually saw it in my childhood is a major part of this, and if I just watched it for the first time, it probably would have been very similar to the experience I had with its predecessor, watching it for the first time way too late. For those who saw this movie in their childhood and are now adults, if you're curious to see what you would think of it now, I wouldn't say that's a bad idea, but not a very good one, either. For everyone else beyond their childhood, I think you know to just stay away. I may look like a fool watching \"Turbo\" at my age and then writing a long, negative review (after all, it is a kids' movie), but like I said, it wouldn't have happened if I hadn't seen it at a much earlier age.\n",
      "I was a fan of the series even into '97. This movie made absolutely no sense. When I was 9, I thought it was cool to have a kid be a Power Panger...now I look back on it and cringe...they must've been desperate to keep people interested. And I do believe that we've already had a classic animated series in the '80s featuring cars turning into giant robots and it has a hit movie out now with Shia LaBeouf (Shia, if I spelled your name wrong, I'm sorry) called...I don't know...(cough)TRANS-(cough)-FORMERS(cough)! Bottom line, this movie would have a tough time surpassing Jaws 4...there I said it, as ashamed as I am to say it. (aside: I use Jaws 4 as a comparison to other films that are worse than bad to try and give an idea of how bad a film really is).\n",
      "Without a shadow of a doubt, this is the greatest movie of all time! Forget The Godfather and Shawshank Redemption, step aside Lord of the Rings, there's a new show in town and they're kickin' some theatrical butt! THAT'S RIGHT! Go Go POWER RANGERS!!!!!!!!!\n",
      "The original Power Rangers TV show was a fun, much loved, admittedly tacky, but often enjoyable series. The first movie was similar in description, but I think it surpassed the show in several ways. But by the time Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie came along, I realized that it was just going on nothing. The film has one of the stupidest titles I have ever heard, and from that, we get more bad things. The actors are bad, but they were bad in the show too. The villains are the lamest and blandest in the entire long running series. And the turning a boy into a ranger. Blech. Why did they bother? It has redeeming features. Tommy, Adam, Jason and Kinmberly, my picks for the best power rangers are in the film (Billy, who is absent, is my fifth pick). The monster Maligore is bloated and lingually challenged, but cool. And...well, that's it. See the first one. It's also on the bottom one hundred, but it's considerably better than this.\n",
      "I don't know whether to love or to hate this movie because, despite it being a obvious ripoff or omen to \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" it wasn't all that bad. The one thing that it was missing tho was, female full frontal nudity, if there was some of that if the movie I would have rated it higher. The killer in this movie is a mentally challenged boy witch doesn't have anywhere close the the horror appear that \"Leatherface does\" and while running around he constantly makes pig noises which I thought was just stupid and didn't add to the scare factor of the movie. But it quite funny seeing how similar it is to the chainsaw movie. If you like horror movies you MIGHT like this. Give it a try\n",
      "Not just your typical slasher flicks of the 1980s. No, this has something to say, and that is an anti-meat message. Saying people who kill animals for a living must be insane to begin with and that's just B.S. like the movie LARVA, SLAUGHTERHOUSE must have been written by a vegetarian or something. Second, why kill anyone who walks onto the property, that'll make it hard to sell pork, plus where was the sign warning people that \"TRESPASSERS WILL BE PROCESSED INTO SAUSAGE.\" These are the questions that leave you scratching your head, wondering if you have a tumor or something for even wanting to watch it. Lastly, the climax or as I like to put it, THE OTHER SHOE ENDING. The last survivor escapes in the Deputy's car, kills Lester and just when you think it's safe, Buddy comes leaping out of the back seat and kills her. They don't show him killing her it freeze frames before that. But she's trapped behind the wheel of a car with that ax machete thing coming towards her so there is clearly no escape. THE NOOSE!\n",
      "Even when I first saw it years ago, I wasn't too impressed. Now that I've seen it again, I'm less impressed but more forgiving of its ineptness. Once again, it's another horror pic inspired by \"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\", but it doesn't understand why \"Texas\" was so effective. It substitutes Leatherface with Buddy (Joe B. Barton) a filthy fatso who runs a slaughterhouse and kills local interlopers. Despite a solid opening sequence, it is all over the place, and the scenes of violence have no quality control whatsoever. It's bloody, yes, but none of it is convincing, shocking or unnerving. If the film was half as good as what the poster art promised, I wouldn't be burying it with my literary shovel. I love horror, and I always want to love the next horror film I see, but a love of something doesn't imply you love all its children.\n",
      "I can only imagine what those freaky hillbillys from Deliverance would think of Buddy, the 300+ pound mentally handicapped killer who grunts like a pig rather than speaking normally. He'd surely be an upgrade from poor Ned Beatty! The plot centers around old man Lester Bacon who gets his property, slaughterhouse and all, seized so a larger slaughtering factory can move in. Lester isn't going to take this lying down, so he lures the foreclosing son's of guns to his slaughterhouse so son Buddy can slaughter them.<br /><br />Joe Barton, as the deranged swine-friendly killer, is the chief reason to watch this film. The soundtrack redefines abysmal, and the rest of the cast is standard.<br /><br />\"Squeal like a piggie!!!\"\n",
      "***SPOILERS***<br /><br />I should have known this one was going to be bad just by looking at the cover. It wants to be cool yet wants to be scary and fails miserably at both. It involves a group of local bureaucrats who are trying to foreclose on a pig slaughterhouse which used to be the bread and butter of the town. The owner doesn't appreciate it much so he gets his son who cannot talk other than making pig noises to off each of the fat cats one by one. This is a very lame attempt at a slasher film, and anyone looking for a scare or a good time should avoid \"Slaugherhouse\" like the plague, for it is horror for the mentally challenged. 0 out of 10.\n",
      "This uneasy, uncertain mix of brutal murder sequences (though the effects don't stand up to scrutiny) and a spoofy tone is a complete waste of time. It's the kind of film that has you constantly counting how many people are still alive in order to guess approximately how much running time it has left. The fact that it got a DVD release (and one full of extras, I hear) is more amazing than anything you'll see in the picture itself. (*1/2)\n",
      "SLAUGHTERHOUSE is a terrible film. In fact, it's one of the worst films I've seen recently and this is after watching SILO KILLER and SCARECROWS. SLAUGHTERHOUSE is as bad as SCARECROWS. Everything about it is truly pathetic. Being a big TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE fan, I had hopes that this film would be a fun rip-off. It's not. It tries to be funny and scary and it's not even close to being funny (in a good way or bad way) and it's definitely not scary. The only thing scary about this woeful \"film\" is the acting. I've never seen such bad acting put on film! The acting in an Ed Wood movie is usually better than the acting in this dreck. There's a scene inside the slaughterhouse, when the fat killer is above one of the businessmen and taunts the businessman with a weapon. That scene is the most pathetic example of acting I've ever seen in a film. I regretted watching this horrible film. It's bad and to be avoided at all cost.\n",
      "I thought this film was so bad it made Titanic look like a masterpiece. Weak plot, weak characters and I really had I hard time watching this film. Some Gangster films are good ie. Goodfellas, Godfather Trilogy but unfortunately this is not one of them. Absolute rubbish.\n",
      "I do know that the Eurovision song contest isn't supposed to be taken seriously as a song contest otherwise the 1990s would have seen Blur , Oasis or The Verve as the UK contestants while Ireland fielded U2 with Air representing France etc . In short this contest is not supposed to be taken seriously but come on at least pretend you're voting for the song you liked best , but alas politics comes into it . All the countries of the former Yugoslavia voted for one another which can be seen as part of a healing process but be honest , do you think the ghosts of 278,000 dead Yugoslavs can be exorcised by a camp and cheesy song contest featuring more often than not Euro-trash ? Neither do I . All the Nordic countries voted for one another while Greece and Cyprus gave each other maximum points as they do every year much to the disgust of the gathered audience in Turkey . Talking of Turkey I thought their entry was probably the best on the night , a sort of ska inspired track played by an actual band , but the winner was The Ukraine which seemed to have stolen their style from that sword and sorcery show from New Zealand <br /><br />A well staged and organised musical event but an event that is well past its sell by date and which should hopefully be scrapped in the near future\n",
      "The scariest part of this movie happens in the first 3 minutes to a farmer's chicken. After that we are introduced to a dubbed Danish film with poor voice overs. The acting, the plot, the dialog and direction are like watching some poor Japanese Anime. I watched this as part of the \"Ghost House Undergrouund\" series and really felt like it was the poorest of the series. Most children will find Scooby-Doo scarier and more entertainning. All the little girls voice overs sounded like adult females trying to sound like a little girl. I honestly couldn't tell the difference between the little girls and little boys in this film without substance. I am really surprised there wasn't the cliché giant robot fight.\n",
      "Dreadful sci-fi entry from Germany, which features invaders from space who want the emotion of love from the people of Earth, even if they have to kill them for it. So what better strategy to initiate this cosmic onslaught than to place the vanguard of the invasion force in a dead woman's body disguised as a substitute high school teacher--pretty clever!! This lady certainly intimidates the little brats into doing what they should do, as well as pull the wool over the eyes of the stupid parents in the community. She's on her way to conquering the earth, smashing every human in her path, maybe even becoming the high school principle! The kids know what's going on though, 'cause they've seen the invader eating live chickens in the barn. So, naturally, they have to plan on getting rid of the outer space boogie-sub by themselves. So it goes....not much in the way of a gripping plot or special effects either. And there you have it!\n",
      "I really didn't enjoy this horror movie, in fact i don't even suppose it IS a horror movie or any kind. Though you have the chance to see once more how talented and breath taking Lauren Bacall is and her creepy portrayal in the film, the script is lousy, it lacks of plot and reason. The child players have an amazing performance. Their casting is very successful because it must be hard to pull of such characters. I think the production company wanted to make a different kind of adaptation. One that is not classical. If you think you're going to see a horror movie like \"The Shining\" or \"The Pet Cemetery\", I'd say you'd be disappointed. The movie gives you the impression, but it never actually answers the questions in the plot. Why do the kids hide their secrets or why Lauren Bacall's is so evil- you never get the answer. The ghost thing in the movie is never scary, maybe funny! Antonio Aloy who's portraying the father is the worst, I think. His character never really involves in the story. Nevertheless, some surprising scenes actually do exist like the kids' traumatic reactions and the sudden appearing of the mysterious ghost woman. The rest is dull, annoying and empty.. Waste of time!\n",
      "How could anyone think of placing Cary Grant in a film and giving him practically nothing to do?! Well, even though it was relatively early in his career, he had plenty of charisma and star status that it just didn't make sense having him play second to Edward Arnold--who played an annoying and ridiculous version of the life of Jim Fisk. These two characters were also teamed with Jack Oakey--who was there solely for comic relief. All together, they had very little chemistry together and the film itself was dreadfully uninteresting. In many ways it had SOME of the appearance of films such as MANHATTAN MELODRAMA or SAN FRANCISCO (all had a pretty impressive budget and sets), except these films set in roughly the same period in American history were interesting! A poorly written script, too much comic relief and a complete ignorance of the actual historical facts make this movie a real chore to sit through and one of the few in recent months that I truly couldn't stand. Even \"bad\" movies (such as some of the 50s sci-fi flicks) can often be enjoyed for their campiness or your ability to laugh at them--this one is just dull.<br /><br />My advice? See any of Cary Grant's other marvelous films--he didn't make that many as poor as this one and made so many classics that deserve your attention.\n",
      "The Toast of New York, despite the lavish look, top-notch cast and occasional bursts of energy, is a ten-ton bore - chiefly, I think, because of the long-winded script and pedestrian direction. Others have commented on the production difficulties and personnel changes which may be responsible for the bland result. Early in the story we are treated to a colorful but talky exposition which sets the plot in motion: On the day the Civil War starts, Jim Fisk (Edward Arnold), itinerant peddler, and his partners in crime (Cary Grant and Jack Oakie) devise a scheme to buy cotton cheaply in the South, smuggle it North and sell it at a high price to New England mills, thus launching the career of one of the fabled financial speculators of the 19th century. But, instead of the whiz-bang, rise-and-fall saga laced with comedy which this introduction leads us to expect, we get 100 minutes of routine montages followed by more expository talk (mostly about financial deals), interspersed with boisterous crowd scenes and tepid romantic interludes with the exquisite Frances Farmer, who plays Josie Mansfield, an aspiring stage actress who is taken under Fisk's wing. None of this ever rises above the mundane. Edward Arnold gives his familiar robust, take-charge performance (see the 1937 screwball comedy EASY LIVING and the previous year's COME AND GET IT which this film resembles in theme and plot); Grant and Oakie are pretty much themselves as well, though the full impact of Grant's screen charisma is blunted in this non-comic role. Farmer is presented more as a comely production value than a full-blooded character. She spends most of her screen time in a series of splendid period gowns uttering banalities that barely suggest the emotional states of her character. She too played a similar role in COME AND GET IT, to far stronger effect. One would expect this kind of storytelling from a Warners assembly-line quickie, but it's terribly disappointing to encounter it in a 100-minute-plus grade-A production by RKO. I'll give it a \"4\" for Farmer and Arnold.\n",
      "Dreadful 1937 film where three con men played by Cary Grant, Jack Oakie and Edward Arnold con their way to success. For them, the worst thing could have been was that the civil war ended.<br /><br />They wind up with a fortune; that is, a fortune in confederate bonds. While they are worth nothing, the trio manages to parlay this nothing into a fortune. Here is a major flaw in the film. It is never adequately explained how they could get away with this. Sounds more like the junk-bond trade of the 1980s and so.<br /><br />Frances Farmer, as a maid to a chanteuse, is elegantly dressed but does very little else here. Too bad that Miss Farmer spent much of her life combating mental disorders. Starring in this film was a disorder in itself.<br /><br />Arnold has some moments especially when he allows greed to lead to his downfall. However, you didn't have to be a rocket-scientist to see this coming.<br /><br />A very poor script certainly did not help this. Jack Oakie was traditionally a comedian of A-1 quality. How many times was he going to refer to Arnold as Yes Boss, Yes Boss.<br /><br />Slavery ended with the civil war.\n",
      "Sanjay Gupta's Aatish is a straight, shameless lift from John Woo's \"Ying Huang Boon\" (A Better Tomorrow).<br /><br />John Woo's Ying Huang Boon Sik/A Better Tomorrow(1986) was groundbreaking when first released because of the stylistic depiction of the action scenes. Its success spurred a new genre in Hong Kong cinema known as Heroic Bloodshed. These films were usually gangster movies which were characterized by outrageous gun battles, heavy action, and high melodrama. Hong Kong cinema in the mid 1980s to early 1990s was in the midst of a gangster film craze similar to Hollywood in the 1930s-1940s, France in the 1950s-1960s, Japan in the 1960s-1970s, and Italy in the 1970s-1980s. A Better Tomorrow(1986) is to Heroic Bloodshed what A Fistful of Dollars(1966) was to the Spaghetti Western.<br /><br />A Better Tomorrow focuses on the age old themes of honor and loyalty. The characters of Ho and Mark are honorable gangsters in an era of double crosses and mistrust. Ho and Mark are at odds with the changing value system and this puts them as people who are outmoded in their principles. Honor and loyalty in A Better Tomorrow(1986) is greatly emphasized as the marks of a good hearted person. Mark Gor is very honorable and loyal in his personalty compared to Shing who is the opposite.<br /><br />John Woo's main concern is to place high importance on the idea of brotherhood. According to John woo in this film, the tight bonding between men is something that was lost among youngsters at that time. Brotherhood in the film is complex and emotional. The relationship between Ho and Mark is so strong that there is nothing that can smash it. The scene where Mark tells of his ordeals at a nightclub as a first time gangster is nostalgic and touching.<br /><br />Famous for the clothes Mark Gor wears as for anything else in the film. Began a trend in fashion around Hong Kong when many people started wearing the same kind of outfit as Mark Gor. Quentin Tarantino loved the look of Mark that for weeks he dressed like him to feel and look cool. In John Woo films there is always focus on the fashion of his characters. Mark Gor was the Rick Blaine of the 1980s.<br /><br />A Better Tomorrow(1986) changed the look of action films with the famous use of pistols by Brother Mark in the restaurant. The first of many elaborate gun battles that dominates the films that follows A Better Tomorrow(1986). Although John Woo would film many wonderful action scenes in the next few years, there never would be a scene like this one which is full of energy and freshness. I enjoyed it when Mark Gor places guns inside flower pots as backup because the idea is cleaver and original. This scene is parodied in the climatic portion of Just Heroes(1987).<br /><br />Ying Huang Boon Sik(1986) gave stardom to an actor known for his roles in Hong Kong television named Chow Yun Fat. Before the film's success, Chow Yun Fat was considered box office poison in Hong Kong. His charismatic and suave performance as the tragic Mark Gor broke that reputation. Chow Yun Fat is the best actor to come out of Asian cinema since Toshiro Mifune and Jo Shishido. He is the most flamboyant actor in the world who is better than any actor that was nominated for Best Actor at the Oscars.<br /><br />The motif of sacrifice for redemption is part of Woo's religious beliefs. The heroes in his bloodshed films perform sacrifices to purify themselves within. The death of Mark Gor is a big sacrifice because it makes Ho and Kit Brothers again. What's sad about the death of Mark is its the only way for Ho and Mark to reconcile with each other. This motif also plays big in The Killer(1989) and Bullet in the Head(1990). The story is simple but compelling. Ti Lung made a big comeback with his role after years of mediocrity. He gives a performance that is deeply emotional and mature. Leslie Cheung also performs well as the headstrong but naive and stubborn Kit Sung. Waise Lee is excellent as the pompous and two faced Triad boss, Shing.<br /><br />Gunfight at the end of A Better Tomorrow is less high body count and refined than in later John Woo films. Still exhilarating and fun to watch. The shootout is filmed in the spirit of Sam Peckinpah and Sergio Leone. When Chow Yun Fat comes out shooting like John Wayne, the film is at a high adrenaline level. One of the reasons why I love this movie.<br /><br />Plot becomes more emotionally intense and less melodramatic with the energetic direction of John Woo. What makes the film work is the large dose of sentiments given by John Woo. He films the action and dramatic scenes with much passion and thoughtfulness. He is good at directing Chow Yun Fat and Ti Lung in giving great performances. A Better Tomorrow(1986) made John Woo an action guru after years doing comedies and being known as the king of comedy in Hong Kong cinema.<br /><br />However, the copying was done in an excellent way. Aditya Panscholi in Chow-Yun-Fat's role does a wonderful job. His best performance in his not-so-good career as an actor. Sanjay Dutt, as usual, is awesome. No credit to the Director, Editor and Screenplay-writer as all they did was shameless copying. The superb acting performances by Dutt and Panscholi make the movie to a nice watch but the makers make it a pathetic downer by stealing everything scene-by-scene in to-to.\n",
      "Horrible Piece Of so called \"Stylish\" film-making from one of the biggest hacks in the Indian film industry \" Sanjay Gupta \". Scenes are lifted from Scarface & Lethal Weapon & countless Hollywood flicks while the whole plot plus numerous scenes xeroxed straight from John Woo's classic Hong Kong flick \"A Better Tomorrow\". The only saving grace in the whole mess is \" Sanjay Dutt \" else everyone just hams it up. The basic story is of two friends \"Baba & Nawab\" ( dutt & pancholi =hamster no.1 ) working for the mafia boss \"Uncle\" ( Ajit = hamster no.2 ). Baba also has a younger brother in a police academy Avi( agnihotri = Hamster King ) who doesn't know about baba being in cahoots with the mafia so in the fashion of \" A better tomorrow \" he finds out eventually and a divide is formed between the brothers . However before that Uncle is overthrown by a bunch of clowns and Baba goes to jail . Nawab loses his leg when he tries to take revenge. Baba returns after many years in jail teams up with Nawab and takes revenge , sings love songs & makes up with his brother.If you want to have a healthy brain condition for the rest of your life just avoid it like the plague. Please do check out other \"Sanjay Gupta\" flicks to find out what an unoriginal hack this guy is!!!\n",
      "Nasty, gory, ultra-violent modern retelling of the Frankenstein story featuring a scientist, Victor Franks(Rhett Giles), relating how he got to be named a murder suspect of several missing associates who were working with him on a privately funded project concerning how nanotechnology *resurrects* dead cells in a quadriplegic patient with tragic results, to a psychiatric doctor, Walton(Thomas Downey)pressured by detectives in getting a confession. It seems that the nanobots surging through the subject, Bryce's(Joel Hebner) system have dangerous side-effects..Victor's homicidal fantasies, desires & rage, programmed into the computer that operates the nanobots are causing Bryce to act on them without control over his actions. All of Victor's associates are targets thanks to his feelings towards them in one way or another. Victor is confronted by Bryce who has become confused and disturbed by his doctor's fantasies desiring for them to end. Victor, knowing that the project would cease if everything was ended, shoots Bryce, claiming to his fellow surgeon, Hank(Jeff Denton)that it was suicide. Together Victor and Hank resurrect his body using their nanotechnology creating a monster after their experiments cause great physical damage, especially to Bryce's face. Bryce kills Hank and escapes from their lab, going on a killing spree acting out those very feelings Victor fantasized about leaving quite a death trail. When Victor's love, Elizabeth(Eliza Swenson)was one of the beast's victims, he will perform the same procedure on her, with another innocent being killed in the process. That innocent was a babysitter and the child she was looking after befriended the monster, helping the police semi-identify that what Victor was saying isn't just the insane ramblings of a very disturbed man.<br /><br />I certainly wouldn't say that this THE ASYLUM release adds anything interesting or fresh to the oft-told story of Frankenstein and his mad creation, but it does feature plenty of cheap thrills for gore-hounds such as limbs plucked from victim's bodies, a gruesome decapitation, Victor and Hank's bloody surgical experiments on Bryce's dead body, and a face is shot by the victim's own gun. We get a look into Victor and Liz's kinky sexual activity. But, the film basically is a slasher movie with the monster killing Victor's friends/associates in various ways. Nothing really original or exciting here unless you want to see some of the same gory violence one sees a lot in the slasher genre. I personally didn't think the characters were that interesting or the actors/actresses that portrayed them. Pretty cheap-looking as well. I'd say look elsewhere for better films based on Frankenstein.\n",
      "The film was made in 9 days and it shows. In particular, the budget obviously wasn't large enough to cover a decent recording system. Through out the film in scenes of dialog (and for a horror film there are a LOT of scenes of dialog), the character in screen is recorded loud and clear and the off screen, second voice is inaudible.<br /><br />Music video-style fast cuts and scene shifts that move backwards and forwards in time are not so much confusing as meant to try and downplay the lack of much plot or its illogic.<br /><br />The cast is generally quite good and makes a good attempt to overcome the inadequacies of the script and production.\n",
      "Where to begin? First off, most of the film is flashbacks. Second, the beginning was stupid, and third, a lot of boring dialog and bad actors. The monster is quite disturbing and so is his roar. They had small parts like when a woman is shown for 2 minutes and is killed. There was parts when i felt like turning it off but I had nothing else to do. After the credits end, there is a minute of the screen pitch black and the music still going. I bet it was to make the movie a minute longer. I gave it a 3, because I like b-horror films,i like Frankenstein movies and you have to give Leigh some credit. My recommendation: if you see it at the video store, tell a person working there that it is a waste of money for you to rent that. So stay away as far as possible. Don't say I didn't warn you.\n",
      "\"Frankenstein Reborn\" is another of those direct to rental flicks that usually makes you hesitate before you rent. Just the fact that viewers are ready to shell out a few bucks in the hope that \"this time\" they'll be pleasantly surprised says quite a lot. Unfortunately, there are not many emerging Roger Cormans out there, and movies like \"Frankenstein Reborn\" proves that fact. Another poster on this title claims some connection to this dreary movie, defending it because the cast and crewed \"cared\" about what they were doing. I'm sure Kevin Costner \"cared\" about \"Waterworld\", but it was still a terrible movie. All the audience has to go on is the finished product, and to be blunt, most don't give a damn about how much work or money went into the effort. \"Frankenstein Reborn\" is a bad movie. Bad acting, bad script, bad effects, and obviously too bad to be released into legitimate theaters. The quickie shooting schedule shows, everything looks threadbare (especially the \"nightclub\" location which looks like someone's basement with a cardboard bar and some flashing colored lights bouncing on the walls. Check out the \"nurses/lab assistants\" with their meticulously polished inch-and-a-half long nails and nary a rubber glove in sight. See the monster with half a pound of Silly Putty on his face and yarn for hair! Ninety percent of this tripe is shot in close-ups, evidently because you'd be able to see the edges of the sets or the kitchen sink. Perhaps it's time to leave the poor old Frankenstein monster alone, this version brings nothing really new to the genre even though I'm sure the director thought he was being revisionist. While I do commend those who attempt making a movie, I cannot say something is good when it's plainly not. This movie isn't good...and when I shelled out the rental fee, I paid for the right to say so.\n",
      "Very bad acting. This time i could not even laugh at the bad acting as it can be in other horrors sometimes , for some reason i felt sorry for the actors in this case. I also wish Rhett Giles (Victor) could speak more naturally , less drama in his nonstop half whispering voice maybe. <br /><br />The characters was not interesting ,or believable in any way and i could not care less how the story will develop either . And what is it with the sound , that was really irritating. The sound is changing constantly between to quiet , so you can hardly hear it and very laud , so you can hardly manage to continue watch .<br /><br />I did not.\n",
      "when i see a movie review with such polarized opinion, i want to give it a chance. i bought this as a previously viewed DVD from a national video rental chain and only paid $5. not worth the $5. all the bad has been said already.<br /><br />the acting is about on the par of a softcore film on cinemax. bleh. the only thing i liked about it (maybe didn't dislike is more appropriate) is that the actresses in this movie are pleasing to look at.<br /><br />i didn't think i would be getting a great movie here and biy was i right. the worst movie i have seen a quite sometime.<br /><br />this one's going in the garage sale pile.\n",
      "I have seen this film and was expecting something quite good, but its the worst film I have seen in a long time, the acting is atrocious and wooden.<br /><br />It seems as if the film was made just for showing gore and forgetting the acting bit.<br /><br />Basically the storyline would have been good if they had picked decent actors and actresses, bringing it as an up to date story of Frankenstein.<br /><br />The blood and gore were over emphasised and didn't look real. Just a complete waste of time and money.\n",

      "I could see where the director was going and what he was trying to express but it was a laughable attempt at conveying serious material. Yes, to a certain extent, people in London 'ghettos' do speak like the actors in the film but the dialogue was simply appalling. The actors, whether they were portraying a downtrodden or a somewhat more privileged youth gave such caricatured and clichéd performances that one could not empathises with a single character. It can hardly be compared to a British 'La Haine' because, unlike La Haine it is so lacking in aesthetic material, i.e. inspired cinematography, gritty realism, and a portrayal of philosophic ideas that it comes across more as a day time soap such as 'Doctors' (as British readers will agree). The material covered had a lot of potential but it was executed in such an uninspired and predictable manner that I have to say I was extremely happy when it ended. The only plus side is that it gave me some of the biggest laughs I have ever experienced whilst watching a film, something akin to inhaling laughing gas - strange for a film which is meant to alert viewers of the desperation of the youth in underprivileged London areas. If you watch it expect to be disappointed.\n",
      "I saw this for the first time recently, and simply had to comment even though the film is a few years old.<br /><br />This is the worst film that I have seen in years! Firstly, it hangs on the tails of the 'Broken Britain' tedious myth that is perpetrated and propagated by the likes of the Daily Mail. Certainly, all of the issues depicted by the film exist and are fully worthy of attention. But could they all exist at once? And do they all happen all the time? Is this what life is about in London today for the average teenager???? No! And that is only one of the reasons why this film is ridiculous.<br /><br />As for the characters, the lot of them could have been put up against a wall and shot and I would have applauded. For instance, I was glad Trife was killed  and I don't think that was the director's intention unless he's far more subtle than I give him credit for. In fact, they missed a trick here. The characters are so horrible that had they killed them off one-by-one a la Final Destination - instead of messing about with a laughable Romeo and Juliet plot (Pffffttt! Like anyone would care whether those toerags got back together or not!) - it would have been far more enjoyable. I would have particularly enjoyed seeing Katie's dad die in a freak laptop computer incident. I could go on, but I don't think it's healthy....<br /><br />Like I said at the start, I'm a bit confused about the 'Broken Britain' basket this thing sits in, and I really wonder what the intention of the director/screen writer was. Incredibly, an Asian director and a black scriptwriter seem to have come up with a propaganda film for the BNP that gets around the present hate laws. Here is my thinking: <br /><br />i. The black and mixed race pupils beat Katie: a tall, beautiful, middle class white girl, forcing her to admit to being a 'virgin' (by implication a heinous crime according to their 'black ass' thinking) leading her to commit suicide. Trife  a black boy - then 'stands up' for Katie by declaring that he had sex with her  thereby clearing her of her 'crime'. Hopefully he wasn't asked to speak at the funeral",
      ".<br /><br />ii. Then, after being given a day-off school for mourning and quiet reflection as a result of Katie's death, the black and mixed-race guys instead decide to go off on a spree of casual sex, violent confrontation, knife-wielding thuggery, drug taking and general mayhem on London's streets and shops  all set to various rap 'choons'. It is understood by all that the day will culminate in a 'well wicked party' where more of the same will transpire. Trife also finds a bit of time to visit his mentor: an uncle who (surprise) is a black, drug-dealing, murderous, violent, gun-running 'gangsta' who likes to carve his initials on people's faces with a Stanley knife.<br /><br />(Wot d'ya fink so far, Mr Griffin?) Let's carry on for a bit: <br /><br />iii. Encouraged by the example of the males, the late Katie's female classmates also opt for a contemplation-free day. Firstly, mixed-race Alisa kicks things off by announcing that she's pregnant in a mobile phone conversation. There is some confusion over who the father is, and this inspires the noble Trife  the recipient of the call and the father - to tell her to eff off. In order to help the tearful Alisa cope with this double blow of pregnancy and rejection, her friend Becky suggests a day of shopping, prostitution, casual sex and drugs. Alisa  after a bit of brow-furrowing - thinks this idea has potential. Off they go.<br /><br />iv. White girls: the characters of Becky and Claire are carefully drawn to conform to Daily Mail reader stereotypes of the 'type of white girls who hang around with blacks' i.e. total sluts. Becky will sleep with anyone for nothing (at the end she wonders around the 'well wicked' party asking people to service her) but prefers to do it for drugs and/or money. Claire, who's a bit more middle-class than Becky, will give you a quickie after twenty seconds of chimp chat-up - if she can fit you in whilst her boyfriend pops to the newsagent for a packet of cigs",
      "",
      "and Claire's mum will provide the condoms with a cheerful smile. Sam, ever the gentleman, threatens to publicly reveal Claire's personal hygiene problems. So what conclusion can we draw? I know! Smelly white female pigs doing it with blacks, ugh! Do I get a star, miss? <br /><br />v. Black misogyny: generally, black males in this film score poorly in aspects of courtly love. There are numerous examples but Sam's treatment of both Katie and Claire is pertinent, as is Uncle Curtis' slap of his girlfriend when she interrupts his cretinous musings and Trife's initial reaction to Alisa's pregnancy. Becky's boyfriend (a deliberately greasy/swarthy/foreign type) gloats over the fact that she's only fifteen and that he has such power over her. Trife charms a twenty-six year old white female architect (she being unaccountably attracted to him) but prefers to steal her purse. Etc, etc, etc. Sigh.<br /><br />The plot lacks all maturity, depth and development. One would be entirely forgiven for thinking that the scriptwriter was himself fifteen  if not younger. In short: this film would be pleasing to: <br /><br /> Some fifteen year old boys, who might feel disenfranchised by the way that the girls in their classroom are so very far ahead of them in maturity <br /><br /> BNP members, for whom it would make an ideal stocking filler<br /><br />Broken Britain, m'botty. One star for the teenage actors, and no stars for anything else.\n",
      "Kidulthood has a good first ten minutes, but after that the film falls a part and is no more then a 2 out of 5 star film.<br /><br />The plot of the film is it is set the day after the suicide of a 15-year-old girl from West London who was bullied by a group of girls and the evil Sam (Noel Clarke). It follows the lives of 3 boys and 2 girls who spend their day off doing drugs, having sex, use sex as currency and commit crimes, whilst also getting chased by Sam.<br /><br />The first 10 minutes looks at the bullying of Katie (Rebecca Martin), who is attacked constantly by the girls and Sam threats he would kill her if she told her parents. To me this was the most interesting put of the film. Afterwards I felt the film lost a lot of quality and highly unbelievable. Don't get me wrong, I know a minority of teenagers do live in a world of sex, violence, drugs, you know, rock and roll, but not the majority. The film does set out a very negative view of teenagers. As well, too much happens in one day, its trying to be the British version of the film Kids. If the film was spaced out for about a week or two it would be more believable. They are other things to think about, such as why are all the parents unaware of what going on in their children's lives, or it seems that everyone is pretty heartless seeing that a girl killed herself and all the kids think great, they get the day off. The most hardest aspect for me to believe in is the character of Sam. He is meant to a hard-nut bully who strikes fear in the whole school. Firstly, people like that don't stay at school to do A-Levels, they normally don't do well at GCSE level and just get low level work or at best do something at college. Secondly, I just thought he was a f**king loser. All he does is he picks on a 15-year-old girl and his crew is just a bunch of year 11 girls and stread lies that he slept with girls: yeah, real hard. At the climax of the film he attacks Trife (Aml Ameen), there at a party, everyone is just watching in fear, but come-on, if you hate him so much why don't a group of around thirty just kick the living crap out of him?<br /><br />Basically the film isn't well written. Some of the acting isn't good, a bit over the top, but Jamie Winstone and Rebecca Martin were decent. The film felt like a TV movie. The director, Menhaj Huda, tries too hard and ends up doing clichéd moves, like the flashbacks and the scene seeing Trife and Alisa (Red Madrell) drug and being upset at the same time. However, for it's small budget of £800,000 (very small for a film in London), it was professionally done. The soundtrack isn't too my liking, but its not the sort of music I am into. I know some people will like it.<br /><br />Basically I didn't think the film was that good, but they is an audience that will like it.\n",
      "What a treat this tough, realistic movie is. George Bancroft, Betty Compson, and Olga Baclanova are all great is this cynical yet tender story of the waterfront.<br /><br />Director Josef von Sternberg fills a simple tale with pathos and great atmosphere. Tough stoker Bancroft rescues a girl (Compson) from a suicide attempt and \"marries\" her for a night of fun. But he gets involved in a web of murder, thievery, and drunkenness.<br /><br />When Norma Desmond said \"we had faces then\" in Sunset Boulevard (and yes I know it was Gloria Swanson), Betty Compson was at the top of the list. With her big eyes and crooked mouth, Compson was expert at expressing emotion with a twist of the mouth, a flick of the eyelashes. She is wonderful here as Mae, the waterfront gal. Bancroft is also terrific as the big lug who falls hard for Mae. And Baclanova, best remembered for \"Freaks\" is a dynamo as the wronged wife.<br /><br />Great scenes of water and fog and birds serve as a backdrop to the drama that enfolds.<br /><br />Bancroft and Compson won Oscar nominations in the early days of the award and are pretty much forgotten now, but they serve up sparks here in this terrific film. A must see!\n",
      "One could spend an afternoon of entertainment on IMDb reading all the reviews below for this excrescence and guessing which ones were written by a) studio plants, b) friends of the Hanks family.<br /><br />This movie has \"called-in favors\" written all over it. Cronies of Tom Hanks, and anyone famous who owed him five bucks, from the looks of it, could have their debts forgiven if they appeared in this failed effort to launch son Colin Hanks film career. This is the tripe Hollywood produces when untalented people are told they are talented. To perversely underscore the movies unintended, super-amplified \"danger of nepotism\" message, it's directed by the son of Lawrence Kasdan.<br /><br />The big ending where Colin decides to bail on college (the motivation you were supposed to care about for the duration of the film!) might seem like a viable message to someone who owes his ability to get the lead role in a film to the influence of his famous parents. Instead of being poignant, the switcharoo is a self-critique delivered by Colin Hanks about the worthlessness of achievements you didn't actually earn. That conclusion might make an undeserving shill feel swell, but after an hour and a half of pained \"drama-dy\" it's the final indictment of the cluelessness of all involved.<br /><br />The genetic mix of Tom Hanks doughy average features superimposed over Mrs. Hanks horsey mandibles is the story of genetics struggling to appear photogenic. Colin Hanks has zero presence and his visual ordinariness is the constant reminder that he in no way deserves this tailor-made movie. No surprise that they chose to cover most of his face with oranges, on the poster. Maye you thought someone else was the star. As you watch this movie, keep in mind the throngs of talented unknowns, who might have deserved this much exposure.<br /><br />Does Catherine O'Hara ever know what the hell she is doing on film? (See her heinous perf in Home Fries, the actual worst movie ever made) Jack Black became an official sell-out with this movie.\n",
      "I rented this movie because (a) I come from Orange County, CA, and (2) I wanted to see how Colin Hanks did in his first starring role. For the thirty or so minutes I could stand of this film, I thought Hanks did all right, as did Schuyler Fisk and some of the rest of the cast. Jack Black was passable, although perhaps he got better later in the movie.<br /><br />However, the writing and the characterizations were just dreck, the worst of TV sitcoms rolled up in a film canister. All of the supporting characters were one-dimensional (if there aren't any lower options), and only seemed somewhat familiar with human interaction on Planet Earth. As a result, situations that the writers must have thought hilarious turned out to be excruciating. I finally shut it down during the scene with Garry Marshall, after they were interrupted for the third time by some extremely contrived, embarrassing spectacles, culminating in Jack Black's entrance in his underwear. Maybe it becomes Citizen Kane from that point forward, but believe me, I don't care. I give it a 3 for continuity and the performances of Hanks and Fisk.\n",
      "Banal story, absurd jokes and lame dialogues. The actors seem occupied avoiding the joke in this poor film but do not succeed in masking the large hole which animates it.<br /><br /> Orange County did not even succeed to fill its role of simple entertainment. Frankly, it is to be avoided...\n",
      "It took me about 20 viewings to actually sit through this stinker. It's that bad! What's worse, it seems like every time it was on, it was on the part I had already seen - the inhumanity.<br /><br />Note to the Hank's kid: you're not Tom, so think about a different career.<br /><br />This Colin Hanks kid has no chemistry or charisma. He's charmless, a real dope. <br /><br />The movie isn't funny, badly paced, boring, a real stiff. I've seen wittier lines in porno. This one is an affront to real movie fans. Anyone that says different should be lobotomized. And there's the real truth, Jack.\n",
      "This flick confirmed many lingering suspicions, and none too pleasant: 1) Jack Black is a great comedic character actor who can easily be strangled by a poor script (he's at his best when he can bounce off of comedy writers like David Cross and Bob Odenkirk); 2)anything produced by MTV pictures is destined to suck; 3) an all-star cast (John Lithgow, Kevin Kline, Catherine O'Hara, Harold Ramis, Chevy Chase, Lily Tomlin) should be a signal that the material can't stand on its own.<br /><br />What else can we expect from a parent company whose idea of \"music television\" is softcore porn (_Undressed_) and _the Real World_ in a Winnebago (_Road Rules_)?<br /><br />This is one of those rare cases where if you've seen the commercials you haven't seen the movie. You know how ads nowadays tend to give away all of the jokes? Not this one. And for two reasons: 1) there are very few jokes, and 2) most scenes in the ads aren't even in the movie (\"I'm this guy...I'm not getting into your college...,\" \"You have to make love to the camera, like 'Hey Stanford, what's up? You want some of this? You know you do',\" etc. -- not in the movie!)<br /><br />The ad campaign makes you think that this is a comedic romp about a kid trying to get into college, and the slacker brother who helps along the way. The two could have been a great team, Colin Hanks as the straight man, Jack Black as the character he is. But this was not a comedy. This was heart-warming pablum masquerading as entertainment.<br /><br />Everything comes together in the end in the most predictable of ways. Everyone learns a valuable lesson, the sick are healed, the heavens part, and the soundtrack is on sale at your local record store. And that's what really matters, now isn't it? I won't give anything away though, because the plot will reveal itself immediately.<br /><br />You need to know this, though: the movie was written by Mike White. At first you might think, \"_Chuck and Buck_...critical praise...independent film.\" But he also wrote _Dawson's Creek_ and the film _Dead Man on Campus_. And it shows.<br /><br />And as bizarre as this is, the song \"Butterfly\" by Crazy Town, was featured three times with no explanation. First you have a scene break and suddenly there are these \"teen movie\" cheerleaders doing a choreographed dance to the song, all looking into the camera like a music video as if to say, \"I want you now, 15 year old in the audience. I was put into this movie to distract you from this films many faults.\"<br /><br />Later, Colin's girlfriend is singing the song to herself with her headphones on, in a scene that was only put in the movie to introduce a dog (following the formulaic nature of the film, the producers must have said, \"people loved the dog in _There's Something About Mary_... we need a crazy dog too\").<br /><br />And lastly Colin meets a new girl who invites him to the obligatory college party. Suddenly \"Butterfly\" begins to play and she and her friends go nuts screaming, \"it's our song!\" They proceed to do the same choreographed dance as the cheerleaders, looking seductively into the camera. And you watch this and ask yourself why? What does this have to do with the movie? It's clearly an attempt to sell this song as the lead single of the film.<br /><br />I'm thinking of writing Jack Black to get my $6 back. He got $2 million for this pile of garbage. He can afford it.\n",
      "\"Shaun Brumder (Colin Hanks) is content to be a bright, talented, but unfocused Southern California surf slacker- until the day he discovers a novel by acclaimed author Martin Skinner. Inspired, he suddenly realizes his life's ambition: to leave behind mind-numbing 'Orange County' and study creative writing with Skinner at Stanford University. But, after being denied enrollment due to an admissions error, Shaun is forced to seek help from not only his girlfriend Ashley (Schuyler Fisk), but also his hopelessly dysfunctional parents, stoner brother Lance (Jack Black), and a host of hilarious circumstances, to make his dream of escaping his hometown nightmare a reality,\" according to the DVD sleeve description.<br /><br />Typical dumb teen comedy with the usual over-the-hill youngsters - herein, the leading twosome being more famous as the son of Tom Hanks (Colin Hanks) and the daughter of Sissy Spacek (Schuyler Fisk). If you didn't know it already, friends and relations can be found running rampant around the cameras. Lesser known Lawrence Kasdan, since he's mostly found behind the camera, is the father of \"Orange County\" director Jake Kasdan. He gets Chevy Chase, Kevin Kline, John Lithgow, Garry Marshall, Catherine O'Hara, Harold Ramis, Ben Stiller, Lily Tomlin, Mike White, and Brian Wilson to participate. Not a bad lot. The veterans are fine, but the stars are less so; and, the film never really penetrates its boundaries.<br /><br />**** Orange County (1/7/02) Jake Kasdan ~ Colin Hanks, Schuyler Fisk, Jack Black, Catherine O'Hara\n",
      "This movie suffers from what many modern (post 2000) slacker comedies are stricken with: the \"Anything Goes\" syndrome. There are few bounds in this independent film directed by Jake \"Son of Lawrence\" Kasdan, featuring cameos from Chevy Chase, Lily Tomlin and Lawrence's own stock actor, Kevin Kline. <br /><br />The story centers on a young man from... yep, Orange County, California, who spends his careless youth surfing and partying; then reads a book that \"changes his life\" and, along with a dream to become a writer, really wants to attend Stanford University to meet the book's author who works there. <br /><br />Along the way this desire (i.e. the plot) is outshined by the wacky side-characters, including two Beavis and Buttheadish surfer pals; a drunk mother (Catherine O'Hara) married to a crippled old man; a selfish father (John Lithgow) married to a gorgeous young \"trophy\"; and a stoner brother played by Jack Black (who's not in the movie as much as is promoted) - all vying to outdo each other on screen. <br /><br />When the main character - played by bland Colin Hanks, son of Tom - finally arrives at the college of his dreams, within ten minutes he's accidentally given the dean of admissions (a portly Harold Ramis) enough \"X\" to blind a horse, and to top it off, his zany drugged-out brother (using every stoner cliché in the book including the usual \"WOW!\") burns the admissions building to the ground. <br /><br />Nothing really matters at this point, and yet we have another (drawn-out and totally useless) half-an-hour to go. All the things that should have been peripheral eccentricities, which end up leaping to the foreground of every scene, are symptoms of that disease I already mentioned: \"Anything Goes\"... Which can be, as in this case, fatal. That is, without that one cure, substance... Something this movie has very little of.\n",
      "First off, let me point out that I saw this at a press screening, so I can't be sure I saw the final cut. What I did see, however, was maybe 10 to 15 minutes of good movie stuffed in an hour-and-a-half long film. \"Orange County\" isn't nearly as bad as the majority of teen movies out today, but that isn't a saying a lot - and that's about all there is to say for it.<br /><br />I can sum of the good aspects of this movie in two words: Jack Black. He's very good at what he does, a kind of goofball in his own world kind of character, and he excels at it here. He steals every scene he's in, and perhaps the best scene in the film is between Black and Ben Stiller, in an inexplicable cameo. Not to put too fine a point on it, but Black reminds me a bit of John Belushi - not quite the same, but with the same comic mentality. He just needs better vehicles than this.<br /><br />Colin Hanks isn't bad, but no one else really shines. I'm gonna go ahead and assume that the majority of bigger names in this film (Catherine O'Hara, John Lithgow, Lily Tomlin, Harold Ramis, and -say it ain't so- Kevin Kline) appear as a favor to Lawrence Kasdan, director Jake's father. They all seem out of place, especially Kline, and O'Hara's over the top caricature of a drunken gold-digger is too odd for words.<br /><br />The direction itself is not bad - the film moves along at a brisk pace, and avoids some of the normal pitfalls of the stupid teen comedy cookie-cutter. All the same, the story itself borders on the utterly ridiculous - it was pointed out to me that the end of the movie works out in such a way that the lead character(Hanks) actually manages to hurt his chances of achieving his dream, largely because certain elements of this movie apparently exist in fantasy-world, where the right choice is always the one accompanied by cheap sentimentality. This is a shame, because with a little work and a different ending, this actually could've turned out to be an interesting film.\n",
      "This is a totally by-the-number supernatural thriller that cannot be saved by the aura of its lead, nor by the exotic locales.<br /><br />Le concile de pierre tries hard to hit all the buttons. Tensed atmosphere, amazing locations, some adventurous bits and action... but the wide variety of situations is all poorly thought out and the execution is even worse.<br /><br />It seems the filmmakers were also under the impression that just putting the beautiful Monica Bellucci on screen with a more neglected appearance than usual would turn an Oscar-worthy performance that would carry the film. It is not the case and although Bellucci does have the star power and presence to carry such a film, she turns out an average performance at best. As for the other actors, the performances are even worse, including Catherine Deneuve who goes through the motion and looks like she wanted to collect a paycheck and nothing more.<br /><br />I'd give it a 3 but since some shots are pretty enough, I'll go for a 4.\n",
      "Monica Bellucci adopts a young Asian child. Years later Bellucci begins having nightmares and someone or something seems to be interested in her son, who it appears has a great hidden power.<br /><br />I love the idea of Bellucci and Catherine Deneuve in a movie together. I only wish the pairing wasn't in a movie as dull as this. Its a been there and done that film (I mean how many films are there where the adoptive parents didn't know their kid was special?) that has nothing new to offer. Its such an \"exciting\" film and I was so \"intrigued\" by what was happening that I didn't bother to finish the film when the DVD I wigged out and wouldn't play, I simply put it into the returns slot and let someone else deal with it. I'm guessing that thats whats been happening all along with that particular copy of the DVD. Don't run the risk of getting the bad DVD thats floating around, don't see this film.<br /><br />A snoozer.\n",
      "I could not agree more with Frederica Boldrini in her comment. It has been a long time that I haven't seen such a bad movie.. I reach to a conclusion: Monica Bellucci is a good actress when her role doesn't oblige her to speak. For example, in the movie \"Malèna\" she was great because she didn't speak much, in \"Irréversible\" likewise, etc",
      "As regards to Catherine Deneuve I never liked her very much but I was surprised to see her in such a bad movie and doing an awful acting",
      " More surprised I was with the German actor Moritz Bleibtreu. He is an outstanding actor, and during the film I kept asking myself what the hell is he doing in this movie?..Does he understand fluently French when he read the script?..Well, I hope that I'll never see him again in a movie like this. Please, don't go see this movie. I'm sorry for the director..but even me as a humble spectator I'm able to see that it's a bad movie with bad acting, so how is it possible that the rest of the crew didn't reach the same conclusion?...\n",
      "Utpal Dutt is very good as a master sitar player in India who doesn't seem to get much respect or adoration from his own people, but soon finds himself saddled with two British students: a wide-eyed, worshipful young girl interested in musical and spiritual enlightenment, and a carefree pop superstar who doesn't care if he gets enlightened or not. Lots of incredible sitar playing (notice how many different pronunciations of 'sitar' there are!) and mod '60's fashions, but a meandering story that makes all its points within the first half-hour. Dutt is both compelled and repulsed by the pop star's decadent world, and their like-hate relationship becomes a spiritual tug of wills. Michael York, sporting a thick crop of cinnamon-colored hair and talking with a Limey accent, plays the visiting celebrity with a snide kind of casual indifference, which is perfectly right for the character, but it does nothing for the audience and he elicits little interest; Rita Tushingham (reunited with York from 1967's \"Smashing Time\") overworks her perky nature and large, round eyes, yet her character hasn't been given many dimensions beyond what we are made to quickly sense (that her aimlessness led her to India and what she really needs is a man in her bed). As directed by James Ivory and produced by Ismail Merchant--who would become long-time partners and filmmakers--\"The Guru\" isn't bad; the locations are great and there are intermittent bits of satire that are certainly fashionable (for 1969, especially), yet ultimately there is too much ambiance and not enough plot. ** from ****\n",
      "This is a horrible apolitical McCarthy Era remake of \"The Male Animal\" starring Henry Fonda and Olivia DeHavilland. The original had Fonda as a professor standing up to regent Eugene Palette to read a letter by Sacco of Sacco and Vanzetti while simultaneously battling Jack Carson as the faded college football star for the affections of DeHavilland. This is mindless fluff. Reagan is to Fonda as an actor what Reagan was to Roosevelt as a President, a cheap imitation. The only interesting thing is that Dan Defore (\"Hazel\") is in both films. He is the half-witted football player suitor for the affections of DeHavilland's sister in the original, and the half-witted former football player suitor for Thaxter's affections in this film, reprising Jack Carson's role.\n",
      "I watched this movie for the first time last year because I loved the first one. What a mistake. I agree with other comments about the plot. I don't understand why they took the parents from the first film, who were alive at the end, and made them dead in this one. I really don't understand why the sailor at the end who tries to rape Lilli looks the same as the one at the beginning who the mother kills by bludgeoning him with a spear rifle. I don't understand why if Brooke Shields, at the age of 16, wasn't allowed to bare her breasts or rear end in the first one, why Milla was allowed to, at 16 also, bare hers in the second film. I could go on and on. There are a few things I enjoy about this film though. I am a major environmentalist and I have often wondered what it would be like to live on a deserted island with only yourself and your lover to depend on for survival. I think it would teach everyone the meaning of life and help all come to grips with reality. There is beautiful photography and music, composed by Basil Poledouris (also the first film's musical composer) of course!\n",
      "The Blue Lagoon was a silent success with the audiences of 1980, not to mention one of the most controversial movies of all time. So, I guess the director just wanted to have the same amount of success, so he used the same story, just different characters.<br /><br />Unlike the way the first one ended, Richard and Emily are dead when they are found, but their son, Patty soon renamed Richard after his father is adopted by the only mother on the ship, Sarah who has another child, a daughter, Lily played by a new successful actress, Milla Jovovich. When the ship takes another tragic turn by getting torn down by sea, Sarah, Richard, and Lily land \"coincedentally\" on the same island that Richard and Emily lived on. The house has change a bit, but I guess it can't always stay the same, but Sarah raises the children more different than in the first film, Lily and Richard know the ways of nature and let their love blossom after Sarah passes from being ill. When civilized men finally come to save Lily and Richard they begin to question the meaning of what is truly civilized and what is not.<br /><br />Over all, I wouldn't say it's a bad movie, but it was just an unnecessary sequel. Because of the fact like I said, it's the same plot. Some great actors got their start though because of this film. So over all, I'm not going to give it a terrible rating, but the director could have thought this out a little more.<br /><br />3/10\n",
      "I can only think of one thing more incomprehensible than making a movie from a bad script and that is for a filmmaker to base his idea for a movie on another movie that is terrible. Normally directors try to rip off good movies, like the guy who directed \"The Italian Connection\" based on the \"The French Connection\" (good thinking because sometimes Americans confuse the French and the Italians), or the other fellow who directed the porno \"American Booty\" based on Sam Mendes' \"American Beauty.\" And if all else fails, do a sequel like \"Jaws II\" based on the good \"Jaws\" or \"Exorcist II\" based on the great \"Exorcist.\" I could go on, except I will be going off track and forgetting to tell you about the time when they decided to make the terrible \"Return of the Blue Lagoon\" based on the terrible \"Blue Lagoon\" which must have had the makers of sequels and rip offs scratching their heads.<br /><br />The problem with \"Return to the Blue Lagoon\" is the same as the last film. It is not about anything. It seems that the filmmakers felt, in spite of the bad critical reception of the first Blue Lagoon, that an exotic island and two teenagers discovering sex and then fornicating (though we see none of that) was enough to create an entertaining film. Of course, the filmmakers did a little tweaking for this film. There is the sad background story which explains how the two kids got stuck on the island, like the last two kids. Who says that Carl Orff's Carmina Burana does not have any influence over film-making. There is also an egg competition, an encounter with a native, a seductive English girl from the outside and a lascivious sailor. But other than that, Lilli (Milla Jovovich) and Richard (Brian Krause) go through the same motions as Brooke Shields and Christopher Atkins as though they were destined to live the exact same lives as the previous couple on the island. What \"Return to the Blue Lagoon\" really is, if you think about it, is an unsexy pornographic movie for kids; a stage for kids to go through before they see the softcore and hardcore porn films. But even based on that sordid criteria, \"Return to the Blue Lagoon\" fails because even the sleaziest, worst acted pornos at least do something to your libido. \"Return to the Blue Lagoon\" does nothing because it has all the bad acting you would expect from a porno without any of any of the great sex (not least because the actors are underage). So if you are interested in a movie where a couple have lots of great sex on a deserted tropical island, watch Lina Wertmueller's \"Swept Away by a Mysterious Destiny in the Blue Sea of August\" instead. It has gorgeous pictures of a tropical paradise, far better acting, and you won't feel dirty and guilty by the end of the film because the actors, Giancarlo Giannini and Mariangela Melato, were both in their thirties (though they look like in the their twenties) at the time of filming.\n",
      "The Good: - Scenery - Soundtrack - Cinematography<br /><br />The Bad: - Disregards the plot from The Blue Lagoon - Sexual \"overtones\" rather than \"undertones\" - More an attempt at capitalizing on the popularity of the original than an extension of the latter's story<br /><br />Comments:<br /><br />There aren't many situations that manage to capture the imagination as does watching two children blossom into young adults isolated from civilization on a dessert island. The Blue Lagoon's charm was the unadulterated depiction of the purity and innocence of mind that \"civilized\" society deprives us. It was the forgotten image of what children are all doomed to lose as they experience life based on societal dictates rather than the nature we are all born with.<br /><br />Return to the Blue Lagoon re-examines these themes, if under the somewhat greater taint of society's teachings. In this way, the purity of the characters of Return is not as pure, the innocence not as innocent. Although the opening sequence makes quick work of any attachment to the original, Return was a decent film in its own right. Fans of the original will inevitably find it difficult to resist the sequel. The trick will be mentally disregarding it, should it prove more unsettling than fulfilling.\n",
      "I loved the original version, well, the 1980 original version, and I found this to be basically a copy which wanted to cash in on the success of the first. The theme was basically the same, with unnecessary violence added in.\n",
      "Why did I even watch this movie? How good could a sequel to a Brooke Shields movie be? The original was no classic but it was bad enough to be enjoyable, had beautiful photography and plenty of sex and nudity.<br /><br />This sequel isn't bad/good...just BAD!!! It has no nudity or sex (hence the PG-13 rating) but it does have nice photography. The plot is so ridiculous I won't even get into it--you can read the plot synopsis on the title page of this \"movie\".<br /><br />Brian Krause and Milla Jojovich are good-looking and have nice firm bodies but are even worse actors than Shields and Christopher Atkins in the original! I know that's hard to believe, but it's true.<br /><br />The low points of the film: the movie trying to teach the kids about sex; the kids discovering a native tribe on their island after SEVENTEEN years (!!!); the attempts at acting; the script.<br /><br />The high points: there aren't any.<br /><br />Avoid at ALL costs!!!\n",
      "As with the sequel to THE GODFATHER, they all said it couldn't be done, but the makers of the RETURN TO THE BLUE LAGOON really managed to make a sequel that's even worse than the first one. Again some bland teenagers (one of them the son of the couple from the first film) strand on the same island, try to survive, fall in love, make love and so on. Essentially a remake, rather than a sequel, this is probably one of the worst \"teen\" movies ever made. Still, it has Milla Jovovich being young and pretty.\n",
      "I just finished watching the original Blue Lagoon. Then, tuned in here to read about the sequel. I read the lines from the film posted here, and nearly vomited. I'm sorry, but not one of them seemed realistic. Then I watched the trailer. <br /><br />Lines from the trailer:<br /><br />\"Remember what mother said would happen when I became a woman?\" \"Yes.\" \"Well, I've become one.\"<br /><br />I almost want to see the film to so how much worse it gets. In fact I very well might. <br /><br />The original had a certain charm to it. It was not all about the nudity, and the lines were spare. It was about these two people having to get along while going through the growth process. That's what was interesting. When love and sex happened, it wasn't dirty in the original but rather a natural progression.\n",
      "The Last Broadcast is presented as if it's a \"documentary\" about the murder of two hosts and a hired hand for a cable access show named Fact or Fiction. In the scenario, Fact or Fiction was in New Jersey's Pine Barrens to present a live show on the Jersey Devil. A second hired hand is convicted of the murders (this isn't a spoiler because it's stated at the beginning of the film). The film also makes an attempt to become more philosophical towards the end, and there is an unexpected twist.<br /><br />For me, this film failed on most levels, although there were a few small things that worked. The Last Broadcast is often compared to The Blair Witch Project, which arrived a year later. The comparison is appropriate, and it's difficult to imagine that The Blair Witch Project writer/directors didn't lift the basic idea from The Last Broadcast. The Blair Witch Project didn't work for me, either, although in my view, it works better than The Last Broadcast does. Both films rest on a similar gimmick of claiming to be partially a composed \"documentary\" and partially a collection of videotaped images by a group of young adults who are about to get killed in the woods, and we're watching them as \"evidence\" of what happened to them. Both have ambiguity whether something supernatural happened, as the characters were exploring a legend about a supernatural being, or whether more mundane homicides occurred. There are finer-grained similarities as well, but I mainly bring it up to give you an idea of what The Last Broadcast is like if you haven't seen it but you've seen The Blair Witch Project.<br /><br />The first problem with The Last Broadcast is that it doesn't play like a documentary. I've seen many documentaries. I've never seen one that looked like The Last Broadcast. Rather, this film looks like how an amateur filmmaker who has never seen a documentary might imagine documentaries, armed only with a description of the genre. That's a big problem, because the film hinges on playing like a documentary. In a similar vein, there is a problem with the Fact or Fiction program, and the actors playing the hosts. Even though Fact or Fiction is supposed to only be a cable access show, the material is done poorly and the actors are unconvincing. Again, it looks more like an amateur filmmaker who has never seen cable access programming imagining what it would be like based on a description only.<br /><br />Like The Blair Witch Project, another big problem with The Last Broadcast is that for some strange reason directors Stefan Avalos and Lance Weiler decided to use purposefully bad camera-work for much of the material, especially any footage shot by the Fact or Fiction guys, and footage by the documentary host, David Beard. While the idea to use purposefully bad camera-work isn't flawed, the execution is flawed, because the camera-work is so ridiculous that it again comes across like an amateur filmmaker imagining what bad camera-work might be like. Characters inexplicably will not keep the camera still (a really annoying scene showing this is when David Beard is filming himself in the woods towards the end and keeps revolving). They inexplicably have extreme close-ups of mouths, eyes, etc. If the idea is to make the documentary and the cable access show seem real, such exaggerated bad camera-work just does not work.<br /><br />Another problem is that the documentary keeps repeating material. Most of the videotaped evidence is repeated many times. The 911 phone call is repeated. The narrator keeps repeating the same ideas over and over. It all plays like an attempt to pad out the film's running time. Also, the narrator has a very annoying monotone, which comprises the bulk of the dialogue throughout the film. It is another aspect that does not help sell the film as a documentary.<br /><br />Finally, the attempt at becoming more philosophical about media's influence on reality perception is very sophomoric, and the big \"twist\" at the end was fairly inexplicable to me. There were a couple other small points throughout the film that were confusing to me, as well, such as why the soap opera director wasn't involved with the Pine Barrens shoot, but my attention might have drifted a couple times. I was also confused how Fact or Fiction, which was otherwise so technically bare bones and incompetent, was able to manage an audio/video as well as an Internet satellite feed miles into the woods in 1995.<br /><br />On the plus side, the premise has promise--the story is interesting, and there are some nice shots of the woods accompanied by atmospheric music. Perhaps if the film were handled more conventionally, The Last Broadcast may have been moderately successful. Even though the twist made little sense to me, the style of the film at that point, which pulled further away from the feigned documentary, worked better for me.\n",
      "I have heard that this movie came before the Blair Witch Project, which I thought was excellent (and in my opinion it's popularity is well deserved), and that it may have inspired the Blair Witch Project. Like the Blair Witch Project, the Last Broadcast is marketed as a horror movie. Although I wasn't expecting \"another\" Blair Witch Project, I was expecting a horror movie in the same low budget style as the Blair Witch Project. That's, after all, how this movie is marketed, a low budget horror movie. Well, it's certainly low budget, but it's definitely no horror.<br /><br />Everything this movie tries to do fails. If there is a C (or even D) category for movies, this is it. Dead End and the Blair Witch Project are two low budget movies which prove that low budget movies can be A movies, for sure. The Last Broadcast is unprofessional and only succeeds in misleading the viewer. It's hard to be specific without giving away any spoilers, and that's exactly what this movie requires to be exposed. Whatever you expect to see, you won't. However this movie is marketed, whatever the DVD box tells you on the backside, just know that it's misleading and unless you don't have any expectations, you will be disappointed.<br /><br />There is nothing else worth to say about this movie. Imagine renting the Terminator and instead of seeing some science fiction action, you get to see a lower than a straight-to-DVD quality movie about something that is supposed to resemble the Terminator. That's the Last Broadcast. A complete waste of time.<br /><br />The tagline of this movie is \"what actually happened that night in the woods?\" My answer is \"nothing interesting\".\n",
      "THE LAST BROADCAST is a fake documentary executed in a similar style to THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, a very famous movie that it is often compared to whether in a positive or negative context.<br /><br />The plot of the documentary is actually very interesting. A fictional TV series is seeing its viewing figures dwindle. In an effort to prevent its end, the producers decide to film an episode showing a search for a local mythical legend known as the \"Jersey Devil\". The start of the movie explains how 3 of the 4 TV crew were found dead. The sole survivor was charged with and found guilty of the murders of the others. A filmmaker decides to gather the evidence surrounding the case to prove the survivor's innocence. The documentary he makes constitutes THE LAST BROADCAST.<br /><br />Despite an interesting concept (a documentary examining in great detail the evidence of a murder case in order to disprove a convicted man's innocence) and also an interesting embedded story (the search for a local legend in the woods), sitting through THE LAST BROADCAST is one massive endurance test. I barely made it to the end and was constantly looking at the elapsed running time, cheering myself for surviving another minute of this cinematic torture.<br /><br />Now I'll go through the individual elements to demonstrate why THE LAST BROADCAST is so terrible.<br /><br />First, the narration. This is a fake documentary. As such, there is plenty of narration and often over still images. For this to capture interest, the narrator has to convince us that there is some significance to these images in relation to the rest of the work. Unfortunately, the narration is - as another reviewer has pointed out on here - done in a very monotone manner that fails to invoke even the slightest interest.<br /><br />Second, the direction. For this story to work, the \"interviews\", video extracts, still images of exhibits and so on must all be carefully co-ordinated to ensure a clear narrative. Unfortunately, everything just seems to be jumbled up, without a specific order or structure. This makes it highly difficult to keep track of what the \"documentary\" is trying to tell us. Also, the home video extracts are very poorly filmed with no tension, suspense, scares, thrills or even laughs.<br /><br />Third, the acting. The actors can be divided into three categories - the narration (done by the \"director\"), the crew of the fictional TV series and the \"inteviewees\" (police investigators, reporters, psychologists and so on). The acting is poor right across the board. Anyone who has seen an episode of a real documentary series (THE FBI FILES for example) will immediately be able to tell that the \"experts\" in this fake documentary are actors (and very bad ones at that). The crew of the fictional TV series do not seem the least bit scared or even interested by the investigation they are doing. And as already mentioned, the narration is monotone.<br /><br />The only positive comment I can make about this excuse for a movie is the twist ending where there is actually a scene that is interesting to watch. Unfortunately it is not worth sitting through the remaining 80+ minutes to reach.<br /><br />If you want to see a truly great fake documentary, I highly recommend GHOSTWATCH - an excellent piece of work that is carefully scripted, genuinely puts you on the edge of your seat, contains great scares and still makes you question what you've seen even when you know it's a phony.<br /><br />If you want to see a great horror movie done in the style of a camcorder home video, I highly recommend REC, a fast-paced thrill ride from beginning to end that is genuinely scary and tense.<br /><br />Finally, I advise everyone to avoid THE LAST BROADCAST like the plague!\n",
      "The film begins as a documentary, explaining how a triple-homicide plays out in the Pine Barrens, located in Southern New Jersey. Although the film captured my attention quickly, it stalled out into early points and didn't seem to connect later in the film. For example, they employ an ex soaps director to direct the live broadcast, yet he not only does not accompany them to their live broadcast, he is basically left out of the film entirely. The shaky camera work, I think, worked well in some cases, but was overdone. Some camera shots just don't make sense (the camera angles from outside the camp, looking in, for example).<br /><br />The 'documentary' also doesn't play out like a normal documentary. It was close, but maybe thirty minutes or so in, I could tell something was a little off, and didn't make sense.<br /><br />The movie had a ton of potential. Done a little different, and with a different 'twist' ending, it could have easily been a great movie. As it stands now, the 'twist' at the end barely made sense, and although I understood what they were trying to portray, it came across as a cheap ending, a 'it was all a dream' sort of conclusion.<br /><br />To be honest, I'd skip this one if I had the choice.\n",
      "*spoilers* I will admit that I was unable to make it all the way through this movie. The two reasons for this were.<br /><br />1. Narrators voice was monotone. When you narrate a movie, it will pull the audience out of the experience, so you better have a really fun/sad/interesting voice to listen to. The narrator did not seem to care what was going on, no matter what happened it was always the same low drone voice. Picture Ben Stein.. \"Bueller? Bueller? Bueller?\".<br /><br />Some people had touched on bad acting, but I can live with a bad actor if the movie has a believable plot line. Which brings me to #2 <br /><br />2. So what made this movie soo unbelievable? The fact that, in 1998, a poor bunch of public access TV hosts had access to the internet in the middle of the woods. Even today we don't really have access in remote areas without expensive equipment. Perhaps I missed the explanation of how this was possible.. but I doubt it. I love IRC, so to see this movie use it as part of the plot line was laughable..<br /><br />In closing, I hope that everyone involved in this movie learned from it. The Blair Witch creators took this idea and made it better. 10x better and even The Blair Witch kind of sucked. So when you see this playing on Sundance or IFC, please take that into consideration.\n",
      "Holy crap this was one of the worst piece of cinematic trash I've seen in a long time. The is no point to this movie what so ever. No one will shut up in this dumb movie. It also uses repetition constantly though out the movie. It also uses repetition constantly though out the movie. It also uses repetition constantly though out the movie. It also uses repetition constantly though out the movie. Get my point? Why does anyone care about this movie? There is no competition between this piece of crap and The Blair Witch.\n",
      "A pseudo-documentary that features such appalling acting that it ends up less convincing than Soviet propaganda of the 1950's.<br /><br />A nice try, but even the early interviews with the supposed witnesses and the law enforcement officers are just too relaxed to be realistic. Anyone who's watched real documentaries about murders will spot it soon enough.\n",
      "If you're looking for a creepy, faux-documentary, rent \"The Blair Witch Project\". Yes, \"Last Project\" was made first, but there's a reason it's not as well known. The acting is on the community-college level. The script is film school tripe - plodding, self congratulatory, stupid, without any sense of pacing or urgency. The ending is completely ridiculous, and was painfully embarrassing to watch. The filmmakers did attempt to make a different kind of film, unfortunately their efforts fell flat.\n",
      "The guy committed the murder so he could have a good documentary to be made out of, but this film has so many plot holes like a swiss cheese: How did the blood get on Jim Seurd's clothes if he didn't commit the murder. What ever happened to Steven \"Johnny\" Avkast? His body was never found. How did Jim Seurd die in prison?<br /><br />It's obvious that this psychopath is the one who sent them the message on the IRC and Jim Seurd was probably a real psychic.<br /><br />It was all a great idea for a mysterious documentary, but the film makers failed to explain several reasons. If the Jersey Devil did exist and this was not a murder piece for some psychopath trying to gain the spotlight, it would make sense if Jim got blood on his clothes, if Steven did disappear, and Jim died in prison mysteriously. They could have explained it all.<br /><br />Rather than a switch from doc to regular film (why the heck is the picture still the same - in bad quality?) they could have the psychopath just leave his documentary camera running as he killed the woman. But we know this \"Last Broadcast\" documentary is a finished piece so he would have cut that part out.<br /><br />I have a better ending - how about that woman tries to make out the picture and she sees red eyes and a row of sharp teeth? Yeah, let's leave the Jersey devil thing intact because their \"clever\" idea failed - it just doesn't fix with the rest of the film.<br /><br />Or another way could be a doc within a doc within a film (like Scream 3) where the special effects could be cut out and the psycho would be filming a \"Blair Witch Project\" type of documentary and the film part would be the police finding the pre-produced doc in the possession of a man they just arrested. And at the end they could have shown the same man in the holding cell.<br /><br />All this stuff could have been a better way instead of what these film makers just made. My preference would be that the Jersey Devil did exist in this film. The documentary had me glued on the screen because I was anxious to see what would happen (like a real documentary) and I got deeply disappointed anyway.<br /><br />3 out of 10\n",
      "Most of this movie is good. Unsettling even. But, the end of the movie (without going into details that might ruin it for those who haven't seen it) made me laugh out loud at its ridiculousness. After I stopped laughing, I was mad that I had spent 3 dollars on this movie. I'm not a movie-maker, or a script-writer, but I think that your average person could have written a better (at least more unsettling) ending than they did. The silliness isn't even limited to the script. The camera movements at the end left me with a couple questions. Who, for instance, is filming if the narrator isn't holding the camera (as was the case during the rest of the movie)? It still looks like a hand-held shot which leaves me asking who is this other person helping the narrator film? I'm sure the filmmakers wanted the perspective to be switched to \"outside observer\" instead of seeing events through the narrator's documentary lens, but then, shouldn't they have used a still shot or at least a mounted camera to avoid the viewer thinking that someone else is hand-holding the camera? It left me a bit confused, but mostly disappointed that the filmmakers seemed to rap this film up at the end without really taking time to make the ending as unsettling as the first 3/4 of it.\n",
      "Flat, uninteresting characters and a poor attention to the supposed documentary style made this the worst use of my movie rental dollars in a while. Where 'The Blair Witch Project' drew me in and ably created the atmosphere of immersion, 'The Last Broadcast' improperly used shots from impossible camera angles (there are several shots in the ending where the only people present are in the frame and the camera placement was improbable for the story), ruining the illusion of the 'documentary'. Technical gaffs abound in the internet sequences and in the restoration of a video frame from static to perfect picture upon which the ending relies.\n",
      "This has got to be one of the most boring films I have ever seen. What the Last Broadcast did wrong, The Blair Witch did right. I watched this movie and waited for something to suck me in. And I waited, and waited....until the anti-climactic ending.<br /><br />I wanted to turn it off after about 45 minutes, but I sat through it hoping for the twist, or hoping for SOMETHING to happen, it never did, thank goodness I only rented the movie....\n",
      "A great film creates its own universe, which is why the subject matter of a movie is not really the point. However, every universe, no matter how perverse or obscure, still has its rules.<br /><br />\"The Last Broadcast\" fails miserably as a film not because of its low budget, or cheesy production values, or less-than-stellar performances (all of which exist); rather, the movie creates its universe, then, for the finale, decides to disregard everything that it has presented, in an attempt to be 'surprising,' or 'crass' or 'hip.' Instead, it makes its filmmakers look like they have no idea how to tell a story. And, worse - it treats its audience as though it has no sense of logic or reason.<br /><br />Which is a shame. For an hour or more, the picture is reasonably interesting and entertainingly directed. If the performances are somewhat shaky, at least they do not distract from the overall allure of the story. That the story bares a passing resemblance to 'Blair Witch' is irrelevant; both pictures feature film-type crews journeying into the woods to cover stories of the presumed supernatural.<br /><br />But, where 'Blair Witch' ended in inevitability, 'The Last Broadcast' ends in utter stupidity. How anybody could have read the screenplay and thought, 'wow, what a clever twist of an ending' is beyond me.<br /><br />\n",
      "I rented this movie based on the fact that the Blair Witch Project supposedly stole the idea for their movie from this one. Like the Blair Witch Project I was very disappointed with the film. The ending was the only real plus. It was totally unexpected and threw me for a loop. The BWP did a much better job creating a \"real\" atmosphere. What was with those generic microphones at the podiums of the supposed \"real\" news conferences from law enforcement authorities? They were far from convincing. I give this film a C (the ending saves it from a D).\n",
      "To start off with, this is not a bad movie at all considering how little it cost to make ($6000? $3000? Something like that.) and was edited on a desktop computer. But, it's still pretty cheesy. The low-budget documentary format is clever, but doesn't really lend itself to being scary. The Blair Witch project is much, much better...much, MUCH scarier, and much more convincingly performed. The Last Broadcast is going to start making some dough now that it's riding on the Blair Witch's coattails, and unbelievably, some people are saying that it's better than TBWP. NO...FRIGGIN...WAY... The Last Broadcast is interesting and original, and it holds your attention well-- I'll admit that I was surprised by the ending and had to view it several times for it to sink in-- it was quite cool. Overall, though, the movie was a disappointment.\n",
      "This film is apparently about the Jersey Devil, I say \"apparently\" because there is NO Jersey Devil in this film. In fact, I'm pretty sure that the Writers had no idea of what it was, they probably just liked the hockey team. Now I'm sure that some of you out there find this to be funny...it'll stop being funny after you sit through this turd. Nothing will be funny for at least two days after the viewing of this movie, you'll be that mad at yourself for watching the whole thing. What's it about? It's a \"Blair Witch\" type film, with worse acting, no real plot and not much in the money department. The film asks the question...\"What happens when a group of indi film makers go into the woods to find a fictional beast?\" Well I'll tell you exactly what happens...NOTHING. And not just nothing, 2 plus hours of nothing. Here's the spoiler, at the end of this very long and very boring documentary the film breaks the atmosphere of documentary by having the individual responsible for the deaths of the townsfolk kill the person who's making the documentary. Then it shows him stuffing the body in the trunk of the car and he drives away. They spend all but the last 3 minutes of the film trying so desperately to make you believe that this is a documentary and not just awful camera work and bad acting and then they throw that out the window with the \"big twist\". If there is a God, and after seeing this movie you'll really question that, he will \"strike down with great vengeance and furious anger\" those responsible for this turd that is so in need of flushing. Please, please, stay FAR FAR away.\n",
      "The difference between this film and The Blair Witch Project is simply, this one gives us the 'horror of what happened to the filmmakers' from a different perspective. Rather than us going along on the journey with them, we are given collective interviews from different people in the style of another episode of VH1's Driven...shows. While I do have respect for what the creators of this movie accomplished, I still hold stronger feelings towards The Blair Witch Project. I suppose I just enjoy going along on the ride more so than having the story be given to me through the eyes of the documentarian covering the deaths of the filmmakers, although the ending does give us a rather splendid surprise. 4/10\n",
      "Just watched it...a Blair Witch Project ripoff...How could anyone believe that modern video equipment would produce such poor quality...like shoving a guy and the video goes bananas...carrying a monitor around the woods, what a joke, these guys could not carry a monitor across the room...ATF investigating, not a chance in the real world. Even the actors cannot keep a straight face in most of the shots. Blair Which Project built characters from the ground up, this backyard quality movie doesn't even have characters. The title of the movie has it right, the producers, writers, editors, and actors should have seen their last broadcast. I would never pay to see anything of this poor quality.<br /><br />Luke\n",
      "If you don't know anything about Algeria, you might enjoy this movie. Anyone who knows the country of Algeria, its history or its geographic location will know that there is something wrong with this movie. The biggest question is the use of French as the language of the characters. while French is widely spoken in Algeria especially in academic institutions, Arabic is the official language and is the language of the street. Through out the entire movie, i haven't heard a single Arabic word of dialog (excepy for the song in the café)which is absurd. The other puzzling question is the death of the prostitute. In a country that is awash with guns and violence, its hard to believe that a state security officer will go to great lengths to murder a prostitute who he thinks stole his gun. I just find this very stupid. it doesn't make any sense. the setting for this story should have been in Europe or Latin America not Algeria. this movie was a total waste of time.\n",
      "I found this movie pretentious and lacking believability. For one thing, I was turned off by the fact that the language of choice was French although the story is in Algeria and the characters are Algerians. I would understand this if the story was about Algerian immigrants or second generation Algerians in Europe, but that is not the case. I do not understand French or Arabic either way, but I found it bizarre, as if the director/producers shied away from Arabic to appeal to French speaking crowd for commercial reasons. <br /><br />The character development is also quite weak here, even for a slice-of-life movie. The director seems to be under the impression that leaving many bits and pieces unconnected would intrigue the audience, but I found it simply annoying. There is a back story for the Goucem's (main character) mother (Bouyane) to be seriously afraid from fundamentalists and you know it has something to do with her past as a singer and dancer, yet you do not have hint of what really happened. They talk about terrorism of the Islamists, but that also does not develop into anything, even as a few scenes in the backdrop. What about the character of Samir? He seems to be infatuated with Goucem, yet we never know why and how it started. Let's get to the guys who went after Goucem's neighbor Fifi, what is their real motivation? There is a difference between intrigue and leaving a lot of stuff up in the air, and I think the director ended up doing the latter.<br /><br />Finally, let's look at the acting. I do not think they were believable as Algerians living in Algeria. Other than the way the characters dressed, I really could not see the 'Algerian' touch here! I like watching international movies, always hoping to see something that is new, or seeing something through a different point of view, but I simply felt cheated watching this movie.\n",
      "The two first series are great, the third one is not too bad (fortunately, Melissa George was here), but then it got really bad. When plots got completely messy, zombies appeared and boring characters were introduced, this show became SO rubbish !<br /><br />The only reason I was keeping on watching was to finally understand the mystery around Rambaldi. But in the end, we'll never know because it's not explained. Not to mention that characters were totally lost in the ending (Irina wanting to destroy Washington and London to have power ??? Are you kidding me ???). It's really disappointing and lots of fans are angry about that.<br /><br />Watching Alias is a waste of time.\n",
      "I was quite amused by the first series of Alias and am now ploughing through series 4, having seen the quality drop remorselessly since the opening. Excess can be amusing in moderation but not episode after episode after ... I was interested to see what happened with Rambaldi but I think I realise now nothing ever will; we will just continue going round in circles since any form of conclusion will kill any form of suspense however minute. I now watch it looking to see how many times they use the word protocol (loved the inferno protocol - hard to top that for over-thetopness) and to see if the actors will surprise me with a new expression beyond their stock-in-trade bemusement (Vaughan), bewilderment (Jack Bristow) etc. Hard to blame the actors when the script is so inane and one-dimensional. It reminds me constantly of the parody-line in Notting Hill \"inform the pentagon we need black star cover\". The whole script is full of this line over and over. And for a bunch of supposedly mentally toughened CIA agents they do fall apart when family comes up. It is clear if Sydney (or anyone else for that matter) were to find out her mother had been hurt she would either break down in tears (to a suitable song of course) or raze the whole of the USA to find the antidote. I also carry in my mind a (slight mis-)quote from the end of episode one which I am still waiting for Jack Bristow to say; it sort of sums up the experience so far in this show where nothing is as it seems yet everything is totally predictable - \"Sydney, I'm not your father, I'm your mother\".<br /><br />Well, I think I shall be leaving the show after series 4. It was amusing in the beginning but enough is enough. If it had ended after series 1 with a good resolution of Rambaldi I would have given it an above-average mark. Unfortunately episodes 3 & 4 dragged it down.\n",
      "Having watched all five seasons, the only reason i did that was because i watched season 4 & 5 first so i had to watch the first three for closure. All i can say is that i was really impressed with season 4 & 5 i think they were really well made however the preceding seasons were ill conceived and patronising to anyone with real sense. This was starting to look more and more like a Steven Seagal flick (only worse this is a series) all the baddies are so generic they are either waiting to have their asses kicked or get hypnotized into giving up intel by Jennifer garner garner's hot body i can't say i am really surprised since the creator is none other than J.J Abrams THE SAME MAN RESPONSIBLE FOR LOST which like alias had a lot of potential but like its predecessor is bricking itself in by trying to overstretch a concept. Any way back to Alias the thing i find most frustrating are 1) Arvin Sloane's implied sense of evil, honestly for a man who is supposed to be so evil i expected gut wrenching evidence of his villainy without this evidence i find it hard to detest this man, in fact i find myself drawn to him and in most cases rooting for him to do something to cement his credibility all ending in disappointment.<br /><br />2) Sydney bristow - if agent Bristow is really the bleeding hard she is portrayed as why doesn't she have the heart to give Sloane a second chance in spite of his transgressions(the mind boggles). The condescending forwardness with which Sydney conducts herself is a miscalculated attempt to portray her an independent strong woman which backfires because we are all aware that such conduct wouldn't fly with any credible organisation let alone a government agency like the CIA , please, <br /><br />3)Agent Vaughn's wooden acting, no doubt Vaughn is a cute guy but his face seems incapable of rendering an emotionally rooted performance <br /><br />In conclusion i feel obliged to recommend to anyone who's planning on catching this show on DVD or tivo DON'T or you CAN'T but if you insist let someone who's watched season season 1 - 3 tell you what happens then watch season 4 & 5\n",
      "What is it about J.J. Abrams that he keeps getting bad shows (and now bad movies like MI:3 and Cloverfield) on the air? Alias is a study on what not to do if you want to make a good TV show.<br /><br />First of all, you need to avoid the J.J. \"Plot Hole\" Abrams way of not caring about whether the story makes any sense.<br /><br />Then you need to instruct your actors to act, rather than pose for the camera. Even when she is in danger, Jennifer Garner keeps on looking like she is making a spread for Vogue. That's not acting, that modeling! Finally, you need to worry a lot less about the hype and a lot more about real quality, although these days, Hollywood seems intent on committing Hari Kiri by hiring bad writer-producers like J.J. Abrams again and again to watch them fail again and again.\n",
      "If Jennifer Garner is a good actress, you can't tell from the creative mess that is Alias.<br /><br />No matter what improbable and plot hole-ridden situation the bad writers put her character into, there is one thing you can be sure of: she will be wearing improbably skimpy clothes and/or she will be pouting and otherwise mugging for the camera.<br /><br />All pretense at actual drama in Alias died in the first half-hour of the pilot, and all that was left was a fashion show masquerading as a spy thriller.<br /><br />Hopefully, Jennifer Garner will get some good directors in the future who will strip her of her bad habits.<br /><br />As to J.J. Abrams, his writing is so abysmal, I do not hold any hope for improvement. All I can do is avoid any further show or movie he has anything to do with.\n",
      "Simply put: Alias is a hype job.<br /><br />It pretends to be a lot of things that it's not.<br /><br />First of all, it pretend to be that intelligent, complicated spy thriller. Of course, to be \"intelligent\" requires something other than ridiculous situations and plot holes galore. I know, that's exactly what 24 does... but 24 picked up the hype where Alias left it and is no more intelligent than Alias.<br /><br />J.J. Abrams is really good at hyping himself, and unfortunately in today's Hollywood environment where TV executives are only worried about appearing hip and edgy, that's all that's required. Actual quality in J.J. Abrams' writing? There is none.<br /><br />Then there is Jennifer Garner. A decent but not stellar actress in other projects, she gives some of her worst performances in alias. Why? Because all she does is pout and mug for the camera. Understandable. After all J.J. Abrams thinks of Alias as a fashion show and knows the only thing that'll keep them tuning in is to show Jennifer in various states of undress and funky costumes.<br /><br />Look no further than the main titles to see that's all Alias was about: a fashion show.\n",
      "I'll admit it, I'm officially old.<br /><br />Why? Because I seem to be the only one to notice that this series is old dug up scripts/actions/themes that has been seen many, many times before on TV. But I guess with youth comes the ignorance of the past - I mean, I wasn't around when the original Oceans 11 came out so liking the new one is probably a big disappointment to those who WERE around at that time...so I guess you all can see where I'm coming from.<br /><br />But I give everything a chance before I render an opinion. I hate it when folks hate something they haven't even saw or tried. So I saw and tried. It was a bore for me. The big deal seems to be around the actress Jennifer and the idea of a college student getting recruited for this work and yadda..yadda..yadda...yawn. Sorry, the actress Jennifer whozits is about as interesting to watch as a cactus growing in the desert to me. The story? Refurbished. The actress? Nothing special, memorable...<br /><br />The real star? Well, just like with \"Sex in the City\", it's the fashion and just added with this one, the special effects. The special effects guys and gals are stellar. But the show? Well, it's a guys new T& A \"Charley's Angels\" and a young woman's new, \"gosh a woman can do everything\" argument with her semi-chauvinistic group of guys on a Friday/Saturday night as they go out drinking and debating.<br /><br />What would make this series interesting to me? A whole host of things but all of those things would make everyone else who is looking at this now, turn away. So why bother. It's entertainment for some, good for them. There ARE worse programs on the air, which is why this is probably doing as well as it is.<br /><br />JJ Abrams is getting much more credit than he deserves -- his series are bland and rehashed to me, but that just says one thing: I am old. Maybe I'll continue to watch TV Land and old series like 'Honey West' or 'The Girl From Uncle' or 'The Avengers' or even 'Get Christy Love' or 'La Femme Nikita' (not that other Americanized version, the real one), et al.<br /><br />And then maybe when I'm even older and I've lived long enough -- this crowd will be watching this on TV Land and saying the same thing when another program by another youngster that is just the same comes out.\n",
      "Is there anyone else out there who thinks that all the wrong characters ended up in the wrong spots? <br /><br />Sloane<br /><br />Arvin Sloane was perhaps the most interesting character on the show. It's not often you get a morally conflicted character in a story. To have him end up bad just did not work. Of course we were all rooting for him. Conquering temptation is a story everyone's going to be behind. Sloane should have redeemed himself.<br /><br />Sydney<br /><br />Sydney Bristow was the least interesting character on the show. She's always good, always righteous. Kind of like the teacher's pet, Sydney is the \"writer's pet,\" and it's just way too obvious to relate to her. Everything is about Sydney. It gets old. How many stories with a prophecy and a \"chosen one\" do we really need? Writers have got to learn that audiences are sophisticated enough now to find such clichés embarrassing, rather than cool.<br /><br />She has no chemistry with her love interests. Her delivery is stiff, which gives you the sense that she's shallow and therefore faking her emotions to seem like a genuine person. She aces just about every mission, and she's the star, so you know she's not going anywhere. Therefore, there's no suspense in the action scenes.<br /><br />I didn't know who Jennifer Garner was before I watched this, so I googled her. I read she's married to Ben Affleck. (Pardon the social commentary, but it seems like mediocre talent who make ridiculous money like to hang out to ease their collective consciences for coasting through le dolce vita while everyone else works their asses off?)<br /><br />How many times did we have to hear Sydney tell Sloane she knew he was really evil? It wasn't cool, dramatic, or interesting the first time and yet it kept happening, as if it were the most dramatically meaningful thing that ever happened.<br /><br />Vaughn<br /><br />Vaughn was equally boring, although the actor did a slightly better job of delivering his lines. He was fine as a bit part.<br /><br />They should have left Vaughn dead or minimized his role. Sydney should have quit the business and become a side character. The romance between Sydney and Vaughn was flat and mechanical, so it should have been sidelined.<br /><br />Jack Bristow<br /><br />Moderately interesting. If they had made the show about him, from his perspective, I think it would have been a more interesting story. I agree with other comments he was a bit stiff, but that was an intentional part of his character.<br /><br />Will Tippin <br /><br />Moderately interesting. The story could have shifted to the viewpoint of Tippin or Jack as the main character. The audience could do a better job of identifying with Tippin, because he was \"an average Joe,\" who was introduced to the spy life. He should have gotten field training and become a main part of the show.<br /><br />Irina<br /><br />Irina should have turned out to be an interestingly good character, who did lots of good behind the scenes, but was misunderstood. For example, she could have been collecting the Rambaldi artifacts for a good cause, maybe to help a sick person. That would have been the twist that preserved the series. Lena Olin did an amazing job as Irina, at least early on, and really brought the story to life. I believe just about everyone wanted to find out Sydney's mom did abandon her for no good reason.<br /><br />Devlin <br /><br />I don't know why, but even though Devlin was a bit part, his self-righteousness was annoying. He should have been the covenant mole who went down in Jack's rampage.<br /><br />Summary<br /><br />This was a story with decent potential that just took the wrong turns with its characters and left its viewers with a bad, anti-climactic aftertaste.<br /><br />It's hard as a writer to know who your good actors are going to be and which characters are really going to come alive and be interesting. Ideally writers should analyze the talent and re-think the stories to emphasize the best talent. Unfortunately, Alias just couldn't let go of its original vision enough to realize where the real assets were, to give this story a truly satisfying ending.\n",
      "Seen this clichéd piece of film-making tonight; now I want my money back; extremely disappointing film on all levels.<br /><br />After enjoying the freshness of the original Pusher, then Bleeder was alright film overall; although it was hailed as a big advertising flop here in Denmark.<br /><br />Anyway, this Pusher 2, of which I hear the only reason they made this, is that they thought they could big money on a sequel and they needed it because their production company's Fear X was a big flop in America. Personally I think this is always a bad idea to make a movie from this viewpoint.<br /><br />The \"story\" follows Tonny (not a bad performance by Mads Mikkelsen but nothing at all special either) as he comes out of prison and finds out about his family and stuff and oh yeah steals a Ferrari; which turns out to be the biggest laugh of the film; somebody leaves a Ferrari in the middle of the road with the keys in it, hops out to say hi to his girlfriend and Tonny steals it...ha ha..yeah lucky guy!!! I love dark and gritty films but please don't give me this clichéd nonsense...and by the way; if all these guys and girls have no money, how is it that every scene you see them, they are snorted coke? It just made it all seem less real and the filmmaker was trying too hard to be \"ghetto\"...it just doesn't work.<br /><br />I heard there is another Pusher 3 in on the way, lets hope they bring back Kim Bodnia !!YEAH!! and all will be forgiven for this mess!\n",
      "Pusher was a great movie no doubt so clearly i expected A lot from this one but i'm sorry to say that it does NOT and i repeat NOT at all reach the heights of the first one.<br /><br />it's generally boring and not so tuff and scary as the first one cause i can remember in some scenes from Pusher i was really frightened but not at all in this one.<br /><br />Mads Mikkelsen does a good job definitely but i really missed Kim Bodnia cause his role was far more intense and now i've heard that his not in pusher 3 neither is Mads! i hope pusher 3 goes back to the original environment from the first one and i'm glad to see that Zlatko Buric is back in this one cause he has only a very small role in pusher 2 and that sucks!!\n",
      "After the shocker(but not a good one) that was HalloweeN III, Moustapha Akkad knew he had to resurrect Myers. Throw in a couple that has sex, a crap teen cast and an average killer in a mask along with a b.s. plot and you have HalloweeN 4.<br /><br />After being burnt to a smoking pile of bones at the end of Halloween II, Myers and Loomis ended the series there for 7 years. When Myers was madly asked for from fans, the Akkads decided to make Myers come back in style. So why didn't he? Well folks, here's where the spoilers start. You have been warned...<br /><br />Myers didn't die (? His fiery skull was seen at the end of part II), he just fell into a coma for 10 years. He is about to be transferred from the sanitarium he has been housed in when, surprise surprise, he breaks out. He tails his 7 year old niece Jamie and plots to kill her. Lee Curtis intelligibly jumped ship after II, so they had to bump her off in a car crash with her husband. That is all that is mentioned. No bloody explanation or anything. Jamie is Lauries daughter, and so Myers uses the 'kill-all-family-members theory' to make her a target. Danielle Harris and Donald Pleasence are the gems in the acting crown here, which says a lot. Yes, you read that right. Pleasence makes a return as Loomis, which is impossible as he was in the middle of the explosion at the end of II. The only blemish on his face is a not-so-severe burn mark. But the thing that ruined 4 for me was Myers. The mask is a poorly customised Will Shatner mask which isn't scary at all, and Myers is an average killer. Yea, no leaping out of shadows and scares here, just him walking about and turning menacingly. Jesus, even that jerk Ghostface from Scream woulda done a better job. After seeing Myers get shot down an old abandoned mineshaft, the film ends with Jamie butchering her mother wearing a clown costume scarily similar to that of childhood Myers' getup. The whole thing echoes the opening scene of the original perfectly, as Jamie stands atop the stairs, grasping bloody scissors in her hand...<br /><br />I give this film a 3. <br /><br />1 mark for Harris' acting 1 mark for Pleasences acting and 1 mark for having the balls to bring Myers back<br /><br />Only watch this if you are bored on Halloween night and you want a cheesy film to get on with.\n",
      "Saw this on Sky Movies a while back and I have to say this is a total mess of a film. Maybe it was because I was tired, but hardly anything in this film made any sense at all, and wasn't one of those \"teenagers\" the demonology expert from 'Night of the Demons 2'?<br /><br />There are two plotlines shambolically merged together in this film, both centering around Kerry (Suzanne Davis). In one plot we have a group of teenagers on a field trip being attacked by bigfoot-type creatures, in the other we have Kerry seeing a psychiatrist due to depression and nightmares (one assumes that Kerry is seeing the psychiatrist after the events of the field trip). A story about Kerry's childhood eventually unfolds but it would be quite easy to lose track, especially with the completely nonsensical ending.<br /><br />It's almost impossible to fully understand what is going on due to the directors decision to flash back and forth constantly between the two storylines, and also showing images and visions that appear to have no place in the film at all. Even some of the characters seemed to have no place in the film like a Native American who, as far as I remember, says and does next to nothing. The acting was also atrocious, even from more accomplished actors like Billy Dee Williams and Stacey Keach. Why they got involved in this disaster-piece I will never know.<br /><br />The direction and screenplay are pitiful, full of pointless \"filler\" such as snowball fights and some half-assed attempt at a love story. I suppose, as far as the main stories go, the director was trying to make a film that required thought to fully immerse yourself in the world he created, unfortunately he failed. There is nothing, in my opinion, that redeems this film. To me this ranks alongside disasterous films like 'Killjoy' and 'Camp Blood'.<br /><br />I'd avoid this movie, it's not worth the 90 mins of your life. I actually switched it off at one point, but realising there were only 15 minutes left I thought I may as well watch the rest, I'd got that far after all. If you do watch it, expect nothing.<br /><br />2/10\n",
      "\"Wow,a completely unknown title.Nobody ever heard about it.It will be probably a great horror flick!\"-I thought when I prepared to watch this one.Was I disappointed after the projection.\"Fear Runs Silent\" is dull and confusing,the characters are annoying and one-dimensional and the film is relatively gore-free.If the movie ain't gonna be scary,at least they should make it bloody.\"Fear Runs Silent\" tries to be more psychological rather than typical,but fails miserably.OK,there are some good points especially a wonderful location sets(a snowy mountains,forests)-delicious!All in all,I was really disappointed with this one.This is not completely bad picture,but isn't good either.\n",
      "Wow ! A revolutionary plot of having a bunch of teenagers go off into the woods to be stalked by a monster . But they`re not any type of teenagers , no siree , instead of being the usual collection of bimbos and jerks one of the bimbos is in therapy and on prozac while the monster stalking them is Bigfoot ! Well it is in the script but on screen it looks more like a man who has never shaved and is wearing yellow contact lenses . In fact for the first half hour FEAR RUNS SILENT has the same sort of structure as the dismal NIGHT OF THE DEMON with a voice over , a gory severed limb , a couple of dead teenagers , several college scenes that I just knew that I`d be watching a big pile of bigfoot droppings so I switched off\n",
      "You really do wonder how a human being can screw up something this bad. Is it really that difficult to make a movie about a monster that kills people? Just get a monster, and have it kill people. And try not to edit in forty minutes of a girl in an isolation cell, if that's not too much to ask. The psychological thriller touch doesn't work at all. It's like I wasn't even watching an actual movie because well, the two plots completely cancelled each other out. You don't care about the monster because I think it was imaginary (or something), you don't care about the girl because she's wasting precious monster time. She's also a very bad actress by the way, but nobody's perfect. This movie is really annoying to watch. There's an intense boredom involved because nothing really happens, we know from the first minute these are all dream sequences and hallucinations. The direction also just plain sucks, you can barely make out what's going on. This thing is just really messed up in every aspect of film-making.\n",
      "The short story told by the Native American, as a prologue to this movie's plot, is the best part of the film. It is hard to believe that the same creative minds responsible for the opening short story could screw the rest of the movie up so badly.\n",
      "Avoid at all cost!<br /><br />After seeing this movie I understand why there is not a single positive comment listed here: it's because this movie does not deserve any!<br /><br />The director is either completely unskilled, or he tried to go beyond what did lay within his capacities. This movie is a confusing mixture of a dime-a-dozen teenage horror flick and a story told through flashbacks/flash forwards which end up confusing everyone as to what is going on. Every time the 'regular' action gets remotely interesting, there is a cut to another scene in which the main character has some stupid therapy session. How boring!<br /><br />Seriously, I cannot believe this drivel was released. What amazes me even more is that the director has since directed many more movies - you'd expect the studios to never want him on a set again.<br /><br />The only thing remotely redeeming about this movie is the short scene in which the main character strips her pants off. And that's pretty sad.<br /><br />The effects are horrible (men in suits, fake fangs and with yellow contacts... ooh scary...), there is no plot to speak of (if you find it, let met know) and there is nothing exciting or fun about it.\n",
      "For a start I'm not interested in adding nothing new in this review.\"Fear Runs Silent\" has a good premise,but this premise is completely wasted.Director Serge Rodnunsky doesn't create almost any atmosphere(apart from the beginning,which is pretty creepy),instead he fills this trash with so many annoying flashbacks.The ending is totally awful:after all these grisly events it all turns into dream!!!Yeah right,what a load of s***!!Three stars:one for a funny performance by Stacy Keach as a biologist,one for beautiful photography,and finally one for the beginning.Avoid this mess like the plague.\n",
      "I am a big fan of pool, and have been watching all the pool movies I can find. The obviously great Hustler and Color of money are the only two of any quality I have found. The pool played in Poolhall Junkies is absurd, the way the plot develops is so slow and preictable and the ending is just dull. To me it seems strangely disjointed in places with many scenes not fiting or joining to those around them. Its not funny enough for a comedy and the plot and action is too thin for anything else. It is a little better than Stickmen which is not even worth comment.<br /><br />Can it really be that to make a good film about pool Paul Newman is needed ? Surely someone with a brain out there can come up with something a little better than Poolhall Junkies, I'm considering writing a script myself.\n",
      "The trivia for \"Poolhall Junkies\" says that the two individuals behind the movie spent two weeks on the script and ten years trying to get the movie made. Well, I believe the two weeks on the script part because the script is utterly wretched, but I don't know about the ten years part because this movie rips off \"Rounders\" to a huge extent. In fact, \"Poolhall Junkies\" is just like \"Rounders\" minus the great acting, the interesting story, the realistic dialog and the production values. \"Poolhall Junkies\" is a juvenile fantasy film about hustling and pool that never approaches the heights or depths of hustling and poker as depicted in \"Rounders\".<br /><br />The story in \"Poolhall Junkies\" follows Johnny Doyle (Mars Callahan)a pool prodigy discovered and groomed by Joe (played by a slumming Chazz Palminteri) to be a pool hustler. Johnny double-crosses Joe for reasons that I'm not going to get into because they're stupid, and later has to face Joe's new hustler Brad (played by a slumming Rick Schroder) in a high-stakes game of pool, while suffering from a broken wrist given to him by an angry Joe. Okay, we all know what the ending will be in a film like this -- its the journey that makes it worthwhile, and \"Poolhall Junkies\" makes the journey painful and nausea inducing. Not even an appearance by Christopher Walken can save this Hindenburg of a movie.<br /><br />The stupidity of this movie especially shines through when Johnny is having some trouble in the climatic final game versus Brad, who is revealed to be the 13th ranked pro pool player in the US. That's when Nick (Rod Steiger), the grizzled old hustler who owns the pool hall the match is being played in, reassures Johnny by saying \"Don't worry. I've seen his type many times before... they always crack under pressure. He can't last, so hang in there.\" Well, no. Since the guy is the 13th ranked player in the US he obviously doesn't crack under pressure because if he did then he obviously would be unable to make his living playing pool for high stakes.<br /><br />And why would a pro-player work for a two-bit hustler like Joe anyway? He could hustle for himself if he felt the need to make pocket money, there's nothing to be gained by hooking up with a small time criminal. The whole scenario makes absolutely no sense, except to the scriptwriters of \"Poolhall Junkies\". And the whole movie is full of idiotic sequences just like this one. Save your time and your eyes and watch \"The Hustler\" again if you're in the mood for a pool hall flick.\n",
      "This movie could only appeal to someone who doesn't know the game. The actors can't hold a cue and are shown making ridiculous and sometimes even illegal shots (the push stroke to roll a ball along the rail is not a legal stroke). Bank shots being played when a direct shot is available.. etc. This movie sucks as a pool movie. The acting is poor and the scenes contrived. The movie would have us believe that someone could get away with betting that a shot could be made on a player's turn and then being able to take the next shot because the player bought his opponent's turn and therefore the subsequent shot was still his. Guy would have his ass kicked.\n",
      "I don't hate this movie as much as I hate Mars Callahan. He is an awful person for allowing such precious film to be wasted. It seems to have all gone wrong during the writing process. Mr. Callahan forgot the most important rule about writing: Rewriting. And rewriting. And rewriting. The trivia section says he wrote this in two weeks. No kidding. The whole thing looks like improvisation. Bad improvisation. We get it, \"Mars\". You like to play pool. And you're good at it. That's about all I got from this series of pictures masquerading as a movie. The result was about as effective as giving the audience the finger.<br /><br />What else can you expect from this? A bunch of bad jokes that shouldn't go beyond the locker room they're so lame. I didn't get anything from the characters, much less the \"lead\", the great Mars. He just came off as a douche. And Chazz Palminteri and Chris Walken do their best but two great actors aren't enough to save this Titanic mass of garbage from sinking. They might as well be bumping into walls for 120 minutes. It's too bad YouTube wasn't invented at the time this came out. Could've saved a lot of people a lot of time and energy and money...If you've read this and still decide to rent it, you deserve what happens to you.\n",
      "Horrible. The dialogue was just bad as well as cheesy. I had to force myself to watch the entire thing. The acting was bad as well... almost as though he was reading everything off a teleprompter. Even walken couldn't save the movie, i'm sure he did everything he could but his lines were just bad. The lines and the formula were so stereotypical, the concept(pool) isn't too mainstream but the structure was. Coldfire gives this movie two BIG THUMBS DOWN! Maybe that explains why i haven't seen any of the actors since. It reminds me of that steven sigal film.... ONLY I COOK FOR THE CAPTAIN *punching and kicking ensues*.<br /><br />p.s. dialogue came up as spelled wrong? wha?!\n",
      "The English films of this time - with a few exceptions - are stunningly awful, as this relic reminds us.<br /><br />Packed with derivations from films that weren't any good in the first place (DANGEROUS MOONLIGHT, BEETHOVEN'S GREATEST LOVE) we get the studio-with-location-insets romance of classical pianist (wouldn't you know) Margaret Lockwood, who is not quite as awful as she would be in her post war efforts, and soon to be blind (he practices walking in mine shafts !) Stewart Granger, which inspires her to go riding in Pony Carts singing traditional numbers then pushed by the radio and composing the Cornish Rhapsody, in which she entombs the sound of sea gulls and breaking waves.<br /><br />Never convincing and never throwing up appealing fantasies, this twaddle just offers a complacency which disturbs in its historical context. Despite it's attempts at high gloss, it's also remarkably drab.\n",
      "Shelly Long is an excellent comedic actress who has excruciatingly terrible taste in choosing films. Watching her on Cheers is a joy. She has perfect comedy timing and is at her best as an intellectual in a company of clowns.<br /><br />BUT she should NOT be cast as the clown! In her movie career she pulled a \"Chevy Chase\" and spiraled down from an attractive bright person to a buffoon. Hello Again is the nadir (I hope!).<br /><br />Where do I start? The writer, Susan Issacs, must be somebody's niece. She is a rotten writer. Making Lucy's character a stumble bum is pointless. Why? Who would think the constant pratfalls are funny?? It is embarrassing to watch.<br /><br />Judith Ivey should get the ham of the year award for drastic overacting. Gabriel Byrnes is wonderful. I had not seen him before, but seeing how he could even pretend to be in character in this turkey was impressive. And I liked Corbin B.<br /><br />I watch this movie to cheer myself up. No matter how bad things are in my life, at least I didn't appear in this film.\n",
      "I must admit I am a fan of Shelley Long. I believe she's a truly talented comedy actress. However, not even her greatest endeavours could help save this truly awful movie. Don't get me wrong, it has some strong points, but these are generally swamped by poor acting, poor script and poor direction. Long's incessant clumsiness was both unfunny and irrelevant. The script seemed to be a minefield of cliches and dull one-liners. The direction as a result appears dramatically effected by this, but surely could have improved some of the scenes. The plot also hovers between scientific miracle and occult fantasy, when perhaps one approach would have sufficed. Long's trickery of her friend near the end, although cleverly \"acted\", was lame and contrived. I'm so disappointed to write this. Please, please, please (to the producers) don't ever make a movie like this again. And finally....how much money did it lose?\n",
      "Director Frank Perry, who in the early 1970s showed some honest talent and an abundance of visual wit, channels the same cartoony approach to 'life' here as he did with his \"Compromising Positions\"...and the affects are equally as meager. Shelley Long dies but comes back, however there's nothing relatably human about Long's approach to acting. Yes, she's playing a klutzy ditz with a heart of gold, but Long has no shadings, and when she tries for sincerity it rings hollow (even her overly-clear speaking voice sounds as if it's coming from an echo chamber and not a person). I liked Long in the underrated \"Irreconcilable Differences\", where she really had a chance to carve out a character beyond her snippy \"Cheers\" persona. It's not that she's a bad actress, there just doesn't seem to be a soul in that body. Pert and perky, she's utterly one-dimensional, pink-and-blonde-and-bland. Who cares if she returns from the dead? *1/2 from ****\n",
      "A saccharine little comedy, with ooey-gooey sweetness dripping from it's pours, about how Long returns from the dead and find's life a mess. The film sets her up as a plain-Jane housewife, with a cardboard doctor of a husband, and a son ready for college. Feeling at a loss of what to do with the rest of her days, she does the most interesting thing she can: she dies. Fortunately her nutcase sister is a pseudo-witch doctor who \"chants\" her back to life. Only for Long to be hounded by the media and jilted by her husband. It's all handled so tamely, so TV-movie-like that it could qualify for MST3K showings. Hard up for laughs, Long is written as a klutz, who trips, falls, spills, slides, and even at one point, undresses herself while trying to walk stairs. Her new love interest is a lifeless doctor who smiles at her maybe twice in the film, yet somehow falls for her. Throw in a melodramatic, over-baked finish, and you have a real eye roller. But what might be the clincher are just some of the shots used. Director Perry has people walking arm in arm and laughing gleefully, while entering rooms, or adjourning from others. Or they jack up the saxophone score on Long's \"me so cute\" smile, and even add a head tilt for Byrne's predictable, \"I love you\". The ultimate pile of sugar is during the end credits, as a photo album is thumbed through. Pictures of all three lead couples, getting married, getting pregnant, and then posing with their babies. And Long is even blessed with twins! Then a male hand puts his on a female hand oh so sweetly as they look at the pictures. Please. Talk about redefining \"And they lived happily ever after\".\n",
      "Shelley Long... ugh!!! The female Steve Guttenberg of the 1980's. Hello Again is merely playing on the ideas that were already washed up in the 1930's screwball comedies, but had least had clever writers and fresh ideas. This is like watching the rejected pages for \"Blithe Spirit\" or \"Move Over, Darling\". Corbin Bernsen is just a smarmier Guttenberg.\n",
      "Tripe of this sort never ceases to amaze me. What's worse, though, is the presence of good actors such as Gabriel Byrne. I hope that everyone was paid well for this film because I don't think they were doing it for artistic acclaim!<br /><br /> Shelley Long has no business on the big screen...just as she had no business on television - and THAT'S saying something considering the sub-par acting that usually goes on in the world of TV actors.<br /><br /> I have no problem with silly movies and cute story lines. But when a film is so obviously leading in one way with characters drawn with the largest strokes...it becomes a cartoon...and not a very funny one at that.\n",
      "This is not a good film. It's neither entertaining nor making the viewer think of poverty and homelessness. The development of the main Character \"Tristan\" (laddie: Moritz Bleibtreu) is so ridiculous: He changes from a tough guy only affected by money and sex to a good boy who falls in love with an inhibited soldier of god. All he was seeking for was her virginity and after he got what he wanted he became a better person.<br /><br />The film fails because of two things: The plot gives the impression that the script only existed of a few key scenes which were strung together inaccurately. This makes the development of the story and of the two main characters Tristan and Josefine appear illogical. Moritz Bleibtreu plays on the level of a daily-soap actor. His bad guy behaviour is implausible. The new male german stars like Bleibtreu, Wink and Bauer shouldn't spend their time on fame but on learning to act (Bauer) and reading good scripts. And that's meant for Detlev Buck, too.\n",
      "Detlev Buck's films once used to be fun, in a way of weird and absurd humour and a lot of funny ideas and intelligent plots. To me all this is gone in his latest film. I was not only disappointed to see this film but even disgusted.<br /><br />I would not even call it \"bad taste\" to use rape as a kind of joke, I would call it \"no taste at all\". This is only one drastic example in a line of dozen others. <br /><br />It is not my habit to walk out of films but in this case it was close. I do not have a clue what could have been Buck's intention with this movie. I would not suggest watching it.\n",
      "After hearing for more then 2 hours of Quran suras, because one of my neighbors had to play it very loud, i looked forward to this BUCK movie. No wonder this religion produces terrorists, because hearing this voice screaming suras is the living hell. Having survived this torture i was so excited when the movie begun. BUCK known for many nice movies before, that all are very nice and comical, was more than a promise. I expected everything, but not such a disaster!! I couldn't stand more than 30 minutes. The storyline is unbelievable. There was no situation in this movie and no minute that i could take as realistic. No joke worked. The good actors act horrible..... I could give it 1 point, because as a BUCK fan i am disappointed, but i don't have to. It is simply gruesome, and i haven't seen anything so bad as this 30 minutes of this movie for a long time. The fact that so many celebrities worked in this thing, makes it incomprehensible. See for yourself, when you don't believe! But beware!!! Mixing it with Quran suras is dangerous....One more bad experience tonight and i am ready to kill.......... :-)\n",
      "I didn't think SciFi Channel could broadcast a worse myth-&-monster movie than MINOTAUR. I was wrong.<br /><br />It's okay to make a movie on the cheap; not everyone has access to a big budget, and amazing things can be done with a little imagination and talent. But there's very little of those commodities here. Acting is at a high school level. Direction is worse. Dialogue is trite. Scenes lurch from one dull monster attack to another, with occasional babe (er, goddess) interludes to break the monotony. The goddesses look and sound as it they're reading cue cards at a second-rate beauty contest.<br /><br />Why must the makers of such movies mess with Greek myth, about which they clearly know (and care) nothing? Here, Homer the tale-teller appears as part of Odysseus's crew. That's an okay idea. Except this Homer (played by the worst actor of the lot, which is saying something) scribbles notes (with a feather quill!) and fawns over the heroes like an embedded reporter in Iraq. Legend tells us that Homer was blind, and recited his stories from memory. There is great power in that idea, a hearkening back to a prehistoric, preliterate age of traveling bards and oral tradition.<br /><br />A magical movie could be made about Odysseus, and Homer, but this is not it.\n",
      "It's neither good nor bad, amateurish acting, poor direction with compentent special f/x,weak script/dialogue. Many movies lately just can't seem to get the language of a time period right without adding ridiculous modern dialogue clichés, slangs and what not. I kept waiting for one of them to pull out a cellphone because most the performances were phoned in, for me the beginning was the worse stupid twinkling lights in the background of scenes of them on the ship while long shots with harpies flying over head were of a cloudy twilight sky, so where did the twinkling stars come from....this is just pointing out one of many flaws and of course this ship was filmed in a studio with no water at all, I'm sure of it. If you're a fan of sword and sandal sci-fi adventure with sorcery and magic it only barely acts as an apetizer, a lightly flavored one at that, leaving you wanting terribly that you had The Odyssey starring Armande Assante in your DVD collection because watching all the hours of a rerun would be more satisfying than watching 90 minutes once you remove commercials of this drivel. I had tivo'd and fortunately was able to fastforward some simply painful dialogue moments in order to watch the special f/x. One thing to keep in mind few things shown as Sci-Fi Channel orginals they are really just productions from foreign markets like Canada, BBC, Germany or worse some reckless direct to video producer. Voslo does what he can but with this material its a wasted effort.\n",
      "A decent enough film, certainly not good but not really bad.<br /><br />The acting is patchy. Vosloo is quite good as Obysseus, Bourne and Antonakos are OK in their roles but Edwards is terrible as Homer, not so much his performance as the fact that while the other characters are talking in a old style Homer speaks like a modern person and this jars every time he talks and finally Gibson is awful, completely wooden, but thankfully she isn't in it long.<br /><br />The story is simple with good guys and bad guys and we are in no real doubt about which is which. It is an old fashioned fantasy film with OK effects although the action sequences are a bit poor.<br /><br />Its a cheap film with a simple script and a decent pace.<br /><br />The mixture of modern and old speech patterns is annoying and the cheesy extra bit at the end is also annoying but it'll kill a bit of time painlessly.\n",
      "I really wanted to like this film. I truly did. The cast seemed excellent (although the inclusion of \"Homer\" should have told me all I needed to know about the script). Sadly, the best looking men on screen could not save this one.<br /><br />The language is always a problem, and I realize that it is hard to decide between going for pure period speech or making it all modern. I prefer the former with some latitude for comprehensibility, but too many writers today don't even realize how people spoke in times past, so the occasional slip into a modern cliché is just glaring.<br /><br />So as long as you don't pay any money for it and put your brain in neutral you'll get through it fine. Chant the mantra: entertainment value.\n",

      "No movie with William Powell can be a complete loss, but he really seems to be sleepwalking through this undernourished RKO mystery. The major problem is a poor screenplay--- apparently a collaborative effort---that never provides Powell with the witty repartee he could so joyfully dispense in better efforts. Even the supporting cast, excellent as they are, seem to be a bit embarrassed by the proceedings.\n",
      "I've seen this movie a few times and while it does have it's moments, it also has some really fundamental flaws. Overall I consider it mediocre at best.<br /><br />WARNING, POSSIBLE SPOILER AHEAD...<br /><br />First of all I thought some of the prison scenes were a little on the far fetched side and really strained my credulity - specifically one where Pedro and company confront a rival black gang leader and his crew in the cell block for several minutes with hoots and jeers and toilet paper flying all around. I really can't believe that the prison guards wouldn't have intervened long before they did. And the idea that the Latino gang would dare to kill the Mafia crime bosses son was ridiculous.<br /><br />Secondly, as some other reviewers have commented, the overuse of the words \"ese\" and \"homes\". I'm not even a Latino and I found this stereotypical and contrived.<br /><br />The films was rather long and slow moving and could definitely benefited from editing.<br /><br />There were no really sympathetic characters and some of them were down-right repugnant. I didn't even particularly like Pedro's girlfriend, Yolanda. I can't empathize with someone who falls for a man who spent 18 years in the joint running a prison gang and is then surprised when he turns out to be a user and fake and not a social reformer. About the only person who seemed to have any honor at all was \"El Japo\" A movie needs to have someone you connect with and root for me to enjoy it.<br /><br />Lastly, there was no optimism at all to the ending. It seemed to say to me, \"It's all hopeless and will never end\". Rather depressing.<br /><br />Overall, a nice try, but fall short of the mark.\n",
      "I am a fan of both drug and prison movies so when I was recommended this movie I had some pretty high expectations. I read a lot of reviews on here and it seemed that people felt this was an accurate portrayal of prison life. I have never been to prison but I highly doubt that many of the events that happened in the movie could occur in prison. The one specific scene that I am talking about is the near riot. The other problem I had with this movie was the overuse of Latino terms. I understand that these terms are used in real life but every other word was \"essay\"(sp) or \"homes\". This wouldn't have been such an issue if the movie at least had some action between long drawn out conversations. The action was few and far between and I found myself dozing off many times. The thing that bothered me with this movie was the lack of a score. There was little to no background music to set the tone of a scene. This left the movie with a ton of awkward silences with the actors standing just making a silly facial expression for minutes at a time. So if you are looking for an action filled drug movie I'd look elsewhere but if you are looking for a way to waste 2 hours of your day I'd recommend \"American Me\".\n",
      "American Me: 3/10: In all fairness I have to admit I was expecting more of a gang picture (albeit a serious one) with Mexican overtones rather than a straightforward prison drama. <br /><br />American Me is a straightforward prison drama. <br /><br />Nobody in this film emotes and pass the K-Y jelly cause there is more guy on guy action in this movie than in the men's room at a Sex in the City wrap party. Add in the bathroom/drug smuggling scenes and you may be squirming in your seat for more reasons than a slow pace. <br /><br />In addition a lot of older actors can play characters in their twenties. Even those that have obvious hairline issues (see the later Porky's movies) seem to pull it off. Edward James Olmos is one man who should never even try. He looks like he was born fifty. He also plays the lead with the charisma of a sullen rock. <br /><br />In addition to the miscasting and sodomy American Me suffers from serious script issues. It simply takes at face value the characters contention that they are king of the world. They are not. It is one thing for the characters themselves to be misguided (as they are most certainly are) but the movie itself seems not to realize what big losers these guys are. Sure they are king of the cellblock. Hurrah, that's like being voted carny of the month. <br /><br />A good first 45 minutes or so quickly melts into underacted pathos (Nobody emotes in this movie, cause they are all tough guys see.) and misguided plot twists (the whole taking on the mob bit was horribly done). The movie just keeps getting worse and worse.<br /><br />Oh and Olmos's character writes poetry. Really bad rhyming poetry. Yup poetry and anal sex, American Me is one makeover away from its own Bravo series.\n",
      "If you are Italian and old enough to have lived there in the 70s/80s, then you will probably get the point of this movie: Moretti's conflictual relationship with the (then) Italian Communist Party. But that doesn't change the fact that the film is weird and delirious.<br /><br />If your clique is the intellectual/radical/snobbish kind, you'll have to say that the movie is superb.<br /><br />If none of the above applies, then pick another film.\n",
      "For such an interesting topic, I found the film lacking in actual information about Victor. Then the film just ends. Victor is somewhere between 12 and 15(?) years old, if that old, and all we've seen are the attempts to teach him to read. The film was neither a film (acting was apparently not an issue) nor a documentary. I had to look up online to find out that he died 28 years later. Of what? What happened to him between where the movie ended and when he died?\n",
      "As though Mr. Bean wasn't tiresome enough, this film puts Tim Roth into a role with the same sort of inane physical comedy, and it is painful to watch. All his foppish affectations are utterly unfunny, but at least it helps keep the movie consistent.<br /><br />The only bright spot is the third segment, directed by Robert Rodriguez, so if you stay awake that long, check it out. Antonio Banderas is surprisingly good, and the whole segment has a great way of piling on the complications to create a chaotic ending.<br /><br />The fourth segment will make you puke, watching Tarantino thinking he can act. the worst thing about that is that he's also the director, so he gives himself plenty of screen time. Notice during his monologue to Tim Roth, the camera never once leaves his face! Obviously, he's got rather a high opinion of his execrable acting abilities. Lucky for him he's a director, otherwise he'd never appear on film. Oh, how I wish it were so.<br /><br />Then there's the plot. Stolen from a Hitchcock story which was stolen from a Roald Dahl story. They do acknowledge the Hitchcock thing, but it's merely a not-so-clever ploy to try and disguise the fact that he didn't even come up with a story, but used some previously reheated leftovers from 30 years ago. There are no twists whatsoever on the Hitchcock theme that Tarantino describes. So, bad enough you have to endure his \"acting,\" but you don't even get a good tale out of it.<br /><br />So all in all, a terrible film. Fast forward to the third story, and you can safely skip the rest.\n",
      "Bearing in mind the directors and cast involved, Four Rooms was a huge disappointment. Tim Roth gives a bizarre central performance which, rather than coming across as quirky, is simply irritating. Robert Rodriguez' slapstick section is best by a mile, followed by Tarantino's contribution, but the rest is extremely unfunny and rather tedious. One to avoid, unfortunately.\n",
      "This movie was absolute trash. I never though that the creator of Kill Bill could be in such garbage. Ted the bellhop walked in a very strange manner and his personality would switch all the time as if in mood swings. In THe Missing Ingredient he was very nervous and jittery and same as in the Wrong Man but in the Wrong Man he yelled at a guy with a gun in his face, something no one would ever do. But, in the Misbehavors(most disgusting, disturbing thing I've ever seen)he was angry and yelling at the kids and when he saw the dead hooker in the bed he threw up and almost made me. Then, in the last story when he was going to cut off Norman's finger in some sick bet Chester, Leo and Norman made he had no problem yet he couldn't even have sex with the women in the beginning of the movie and was throwing up all over the place in the Misbehavors. It was like some creepy remote hotel where there was only Ted and the people in the four rooms but it was actually in L.A where there would be many other hotel staff and you would see some guests. He was totally alone except for the significant characters and I found it strange and irritating. They had Antonio Banderas, Selma Hayek and Quentin Tarantino(hope I'm not forgetting anyone) but the movie still managed to be worse than dirt. The actors were horrible, even Banderas, Hayek and Tarantino and it turned out to be the biggest disappointment since Underworld. If only there was a negative number on the Vote cause this movie deserves to be taken to the desert and buried.\n",
      "Tarantino and Rodriguez are two of my favourite directors but this film still left me cold. Maybe it was because I was expecting so much. When I was told about the film it sounded great -four rooms, four directors- two of which I loved. But sadly as is always the case when you expect something brilliant you rarely feel satisfied, and for me this was an extremely unsatisfying film.<br /><br />Out of the whole cast there were only 3 characters I liked - the 2 kids in The Misbehaviors and Marisa Tomei. For me the rest were at best boring and at worst irritating to the point of actual anger. I really like Tim Roth, normally, but his character actually made me angry, he was so irritating and slapstick that I wanted him to get killed in some horrendous way, something I never wish for the protagonist of a film. Actually he didn't annoy me throughout entirely, when he didn't speak in that stupid idiot voice he was OK, the rest of the time he was Peewee Hermin.<br /><br />This is just my opinion and is of course subject to change as maybe if I watched it again at the right time and in the right mood I may see something I missed and get what all the people who enjoyed the movie got. I don't think I could take the risk though.\n",
      "I really can't understand those who like this movie, and I really can't understand this movie!The first two episodes are totally nonsense, and I think the first is the worst of the movie. The only part I liked is the Rodriguez one because Banderas is really funny and the plot and the circumstances are fine. The fourth part of the movie, or the fourth room is not totally bad but I think it's boring. Tarantino speaks, speaks and speaks again, but the action of the finger-cutting is too short. Really bad in this movie is also the Tim Roth's Character, with that strange way to walk, to run , to talk or to make lots of thing! My conclusion is that this movie is not funny in a good way, but in a really stupid way!\n",
      "Maybe other people appreciate this, but if you are a fan of Zucker Abram Zucker type films (airplane etc.) or Ben Stiller movies, you won't find much to laugh about in this film. I didn't find anything save for (spoiler) the finger cutting off scene at the end, which is a twist on the way movies usually do things. Even that was not laugh out loud funny, more funny in the sense of \"We are in on QT's joke about the film industry\". Big Deal.<br /><br />This movie is worth it's 5.9 rating, i.e. it is below average. Don't bother. It must have gotten that rating for the elements of drama that it had, it seems that great comedies such as Austin Powers series etc. can't push more than mid 7s without having an element of \"social significance\" or drama as Dr Strangelove might have.\n",
      "Four Rooms is a collection of four stories -- all of which take place within the same hotel. The first segment (\"The Missing Ingredient\") is, quite possibly, some of the worst drivel I have ever watched. It's downright painful to sit through. I got the strong impression that it was written very quickly, and that it was written with the intention of being humorous by a person who doesn't know the first thing about humor.<br /><br />I can't even remember the 2nd story (\"The Wrong Man\"), which is a testament to the poor quality of the first half of this tape.<br /><br />Thankfully, things start to pickup with the 3rd installment \"The Misbehavers\" (written by Robert Rodriguez). I'm glad it came along when it did, because I was painfully close to ejecting the tape. This segment is, by far, the best of the lot.<br /><br />The 4th segment, \"The Man from Hollywood\" is exactly what you'd expect from Quinten Tarantino. It's chock full of outrageous dialogue and Tarantino overacts like there's no tomorrow.<br /><br />All in all, this is not a \"movie\" worth renting.<br /><br />I give the first two segments a 3/10, I give the latter two segments a 6/10. Overall I'd rate it a 4/10.\n",
      "FOUR ROOMS / (1995) *1/2 (out of four)<br /><br />\"I'm in a situation I can't begin to explain.\" -Ted the Bellhop<br /><br />You can say that again! For Ted the Bellhop, things go from strange, to stranger, to even stranger in the comedy \"Four Rooms,\" a film that is really four films by four separate teams of filmmakers, all linked by location and a single character under increasingly urgent circumstances. When another character asks Ted his problem, his response is right on the money: \"Problem? I haven't got a problem. I've got f*cking problems. Plural.\" One could also say that about this movie, a confusing, pointless mess of stale, unfunny humor, overacted characters, and a load of Hollywood stars and filmmakers so prestigious that it makes us wonder why such people would involve themselves such an unentertaining flop.<br /><br />\"Four Rooms\" stars Tim Roth in a biting, fanatical performance as Ted, a bellhop working at a faded hotel. He is the only person on duty this night, and he really gets his hands full. In the first story, called \"The Missing Ingredient,\" written and directed by Alison Anders, Ted checks in a clan of witches who try to perform a resurrection but can't because they lack a certain component in their spell. Naturally, its semen. What other bodily fluid is there in movies these days? Ted is the only male around, therefore, its only a matter of time before Ted finds himself seduced by a bare-breasted witch.<br /><br />The next segment, called \"The Wrong Man,\" written and directed by Alexander Rockwell, is equally as bad, if not worse (it's a tough call) as the first. Ted walks into a room with a manic depressive lunatic who holds his wife at gun point to test her fidelity. Ted becomes the middle man, with no where to run and nowhere to hide.<br /><br />Robert Rodriguez writes and directs the film's best part, though that's not saying a whole lot. It's called \"The Misbehavers\" and features Rodriguez's \"Desperado\" actor Antonia Banderas. He leads his rich, fancy family to the hotel, then abandons his two chaotic children to spend New Year's Eve with his lovely wife. He pays Ted five-hundred dollars to baby-sit them for a few hours. After a predictable hell breaks loose, Ted concludes this situation with the following reflection: \"There's a putrid, rotting corpse of a dead whore stuck in the springs of the bed. There's rooms blazing afire. There's a big fat needle from God knows where, stuck in my leg, infecting me with God knows what. And finally there's me, walking out the door, right f*cking now. Buenas noches.\"<br /><br />\"The Man from Hollywood\" is the film's finale, by \"Pulp Fiction\" director Quentin Tarantino. Tarantino himself stars as an obnoxious Hollywood star who rents a suite with his bizarre arrangement of friends, including Bruce Willis as a man with marital difficulties. By the time Ted walks in, they're drunk and doing a replay of an old Alfred Hitchcock TV episode where a man bets he can light his lighter 10 times in a row. If he loses, he also loses his pinkie finger. This episode probably holds the record for containing the most four letter words in twenty minutes.<br /><br />\"Four Rooms\" has reportedly been substantially cut since its disastrous September 1995 screening at the Toronto Film Festival, but it's hard to imagine the film running any longer. The first half is a painful experience, while the second half is simply not good. The film has a lot of energy, a cute little theme song and opening credit sequence, and Tim Roth is hard at work here, quirky and full of life. But he is all by himself, not supported by the writing--there are problems within his character. The key to a movie like this is to keep the connecting character consistent through his experiences.<br /><br />However, \"Four Rooms\" changes him from meek and timid to explosively reactive. It's hard to laugh at jokes about abnormalities when the main character is almost deranged himself.<br /><br />The four film's connect well, and I kind of liked some of the material in the closing segments, including the performances by Bruce Willis and Quentin Tarantino. But even here the situation is disposable and the dialogue is all over the wall. \"Four Rooms\" keeps us stuck in a series of stories that are not funny, entertaining, or engaging, but lackluster and deprived.<br /><br />The film was released on Christmas Day, which really amazes me. This movie is R-rated and intended for adult audiences only, containing everything from plotless nudity to streaming vulgarisms. Most movies released on this family-oriented holiday are, well, somewhat tactful, but not \"Four Rooms.\" The sheer nerve of the studio to release the film on December 25th should in itself be a good sign of its audacity. Consider yourself warned.<br /><br />\n",
      "I curled up with this one last night and felt like i was \"looking for love in all the wrong places\". What did Tim Roth think he was doing? Actually, I watched it because i expected the bellboy character to evolve through the four episodes. The first episode didn't turn me off. In fact, the incantatory rhymes of Eva the all-girl witch were one of the few good laughs in the whole four-part joint. The next bit of absurdity, Room 404, has been done so much better elsewhere. Jennifer Beals' acting kept me involved here, believing some actual content might emerge -- like a plot? Her eyes promised so much! The dialogue gave so little! From time to time the art direction was notably okay. Charming. Meanwhile, wincing at every other facial maneuver Roth tries. So, by the time we get to Rodriguez's great kids, the big ones and the little ones, a parallel of adult/child misbehaviors, Roth is hardening, yes? He calls into the (cliche) pad of his boss, firm, resolute, quitting. Now I'm yawning. Yes! Yes! get this thing over with. Just one more room (oh, dang!). Is that Bruce Willis? Will he punch Quentin Tarantino in the jaw and shut him up? The bellboy, the twitching Candide, does come through in the end. But i was asleep, and had to rewind to see what happened. Quentin Tarantino is apparently some kind of loser that people talk about with excitement. The shock value of being \"bad\" is something a lot of us worked through when we were pre-adolescent. Some took it to advanced stages. Some are still working out their anger issues. Some are doing hard time. Some are dead. The writer/director has to be very sharp to make this funny. QT should pay me to watch his work.\n",
      "Vicious murderer William Holden and his gang break into the lodge of the pipe-smoking psychiatrist Lee J. Cobb, who is having guests. Holden and the gang hold them hostage. Holden, as it develops, is having some mental problems. Cobb quickly cures him and Holden is never able to fire a gun again and he is free of symptoms and nightmares and is led off peacefully to jail.<br /><br />It's a tough slog. Every piece of work has to be judged in terms of its period, we know, but this may have been fatigued even by 1950 standards. We had, after all, already had Hitchcock's \"Spellbound\", of which this is more or less a copy. These days, after a decade or two of \"getting in touch with our feelings\" (what does that MEAN?) it looks more dated and more schematic than ever.<br /><br />The Freudian version of psychoanalysis was the canon at the time. A psychiatrist had to read ALL of Freud's seventeen volumes of work and know them inside and out. And this story sticks to material that might be found in \"Psychoanalysis for Dummies.\" Everything is laid out for the audience, beginning with the conscious and the unconscious, and later leading through a handbook of dream interpretation and even dabbling with the Oedipal complex, although that part isn't gone into to any great extent. Let's take into account the sensibilities of the audience. Let's just have Holden kill his father, steal his father's \"gun\", and live happily at home with his mother.<br /><br />The quick cure we see was always mythological. Just ask Woody Allan. Not that it hasn't been tried with psychoanalytic theory. When it became clear that very few people could afford to throw away a fortune on an unending psychoanalysis, psychiatrists developed other, shorter forms of treatment. One of them, William (\"Wild Bill\") Murphy invented sector therapy, which was a kind of psychoanalytic quick fix, a band aid rather than an psychological excavation. I lost track of the evaluative literature but sector therapy probably had the same success rate as its model.<br /><br />It would be nice to say that, despite the datedness of the material, it's well done, but that, alas, isn't the case. Rudolph Mate's direction is uninspired. The subplots are mechanical. The acting is perfunctory, though we have to say that Lee J. Cobb is a good psychiatrist. A little adventurous, true, but under the circumstances, such as having a pistol pressed against his belly -- well. Nina Foch is good as Holden's necessarily motherly girl friend too. William Holden gives the hammiest performance of his career, popping his eyes, grimacing, calling everything \"screwy.\" Too bad. It has a fine noirish title -- \"The Dark Past.\" But this past was prologue to nothing.\n",
      "Holden had a great eye for a good script and always chose interesting three-dimensional characters and interesting situations. Other than this one, that is. Terribly dated and talky psychological drama that goes nowhere slow. One can only think Holden was forced to work on this picture, which hits you over the head with salvo after salvo of predictable psuedo-psychological double talk and laughable explorations into \"hidden traumatic childhood incidents\" intended to sensitively explicate present behavior in painfully simplistic terms. There is much unintentional laughter, but this is not a fun or funny movie. The great Lee J. Cobb is particularly wasted in a do-nothing part. Do yourself a favor and go rent BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI or SUNSET BOULEVARD or STALAG 17 and put this psychobabble snoozefest back on the shelf.\n",
      "I can only assume this short's popularity has something to do with its political incorrectness; in itself it's rather lame. How funny is it really to see a grunting halfwit running around in circles after a bunch of little kids? The film does have its moments, especially with Spanky and Bumbo in the kitchen, but overall it reminded me a lot of that standard childhood nightmare of being chased by a gorilla, except not as exciting. I pass on this one.\n",
      "What this low budget film has going for it is a terrific performance by Nick Stahl. He plays Dodge, a young and straight hustler who works the streets in a gay area of Toronto. Dodge does drugs to quell the emotional pain of having to work at something so debasing. He spends his time alternating between walking the streets, living with fellow hustlers in a dilapidated loft, talking with a diner waitress (well played by Michele-Barbara Pelletier), and teaching a new recruit named Oliver the ins and outs of the \"business\".<br /><br />The script is not well written. Questions are left unanswered. And there's lots of downtime wherein not much happens. The result is considerable tedium and boredom, not just for the characters but for viewers as well. The story is depressing because the characters are all so hopeless.<br /><br />Another problem here is that the concept is not original. We've seen all this before in other films, like \"My Own Private Idaho\". I'm not sure what the point of \"Twist\" is, apart from being a contemporary update of the Oliver Twist story. I do like the music at the film's start, and it recurs off and on throughout.<br /><br />Low-key, and very slowly paced, with long camera \"takes\", this bleak story would have been better with a little more substantive action. Other than Nick Stahl's fine performance, the movie does have atmosphere, albeit dreary, but not much else.\n",
      "Looking at this movie, I wondered if I did not already see it. The theme is not original (anymore), we have seen the setting in other movies, the acting is poor, as is the story. So, there is no reason why I should recommend this movie to anybody.\n",
      "In the last ten or so years, there has been a rash of movies starring young, white, straight-seeming actors portraying bedraggled streetwise hustlers, with all scenarios (it would seem) stemming from Gus Van Sant's \"My Own Private Idaho\". This one has the conceit of being a gay updating of Dickens (!) with Nick Stahl as sort of an Artful Dodger of Queer Toronto. The trouble with \"Twist\" is...that's the only twist, and it isn't a groundbreaking one. These kids, who seem to turn tricks for coffee, cigarettes and the occasional needle, have nothing much to offer us except their names. We see the seedy side of life yet we're given little explanation why Stahl and his friends are so belligerent against hope, without any imagination or the drive to get out and succeed. *1/2 from ****\n",
      "I saw this as part of the '04 San Francisco GLBT film fest. The description seemed interesting enough, and Nick Stahl has made a couple good movie choices, so I figured it was a safe bet. Wrong-o. Can we please put an end to the male hustler genre? This Dickinsian train wreck could have been just as easily made by piecing together scenes from the fair \"Johns,\" the violent for violence-sake \"Bully,\" and the utterly stupid \"Speedway Junkies.\"<br /><br />The movie had a couple nice shots, but any art of the film was wasted by the story. I also really liked the soundtrack. Those two highlights do not justify the 98 minutes of my attention that I gave to this film. I couldn't get out of the theater quick enough, and considered walking out more than once.<br /><br />Anyone who feels the slightest tug toward this movie should just rewatch \"My Own Private Idaho\" (if you want a hustler movie) or \"In the Bedroom\" (if you want a Nick Stahl movie) and buy an Alison Kraus album (for the alt-country/bluegrass soundtrack).\n",
      "When I walked in, I wondered why the theatre was empty. I wanted to like this movie. Hey, Gary Farmer's a funny guy. I hoped to see something balanced, lifelike, with ups and downs. Instead what I saw was a \"scared straight\"-style, here's-how-bad-it-can-get cliché without any relief, either humorous or realistic.<br /><br />I was supposed to get taken in by the comparison of this movie to Dicken's story. Except it was nothing like Dicken's story, except for the names and the squalor. The Victorian gentleman had a handle on reality; this paternalistic and uninspired film wants to paint everything outside the mainstream worldview as endlessly fear-driven and hopeless. It's as if the writers wanted to us to think that Dickens was a pollyanna and wanted us to know how bad things *really* are.<br /><br />Do such awful things actually happen? For sure. Do -all- of these things happen to real people in the real world? No. Which makes Twist a horror film -- if that's what you're after.<br /><br />Maybe someone wanted kids to know what they might face if they ran away from abusive homes to the big city. In that case, they should have found out what kids face -- verisimiltude anyone? -- instead of throwing together an orgy of dark imaginations.\n",
      "Stone is one of the worst movies ever made: inept direction; bad (funny) dialog, low production expertise and values, bad editing and endless boring sequences of motorcycles as if a bike on a road is interesting cinema. Yes, there is a big stunt, but that does not make a film.<br /><br />The movie is a boring and unintentionally funny, ridiculous counter culture trip that owes much to Easy Rider without a Hopper or Nicholson.<br /><br />Stone's special sentimental place in Australia must be due to the audience's thrill at seeing their own on film. Some movies should be banned to save a country total humiliation - and Stone is one of them.\n",
      "I watched this to see Fred Astaire dance and Cyd Charisse to smile and show off her legs and dancing talents. I got very little of the above. Astaire, as \"Steve Canfield,\" sang a lot more than he danced, and his singing was always \"fair, at best.\" <br /><br />Charisse's character, \"Ninotchka Yoschenko,\" mostly pouted throughout the film and spoke with a stupid accent, not exactly appealing. It also takes away from the film when you know someone else is singing, not her! <br /><br />To be fair, some of their work here together just makes you marvel at them. Perhaps another look - this time with a CinemaScope widescreen DVD picture, - would make me appreciate this movie more.<br /><br />This is a musical remake of the 1939 Greta Garbo film \"Ninotochka.\" I don't think either is all that great but given the choice to watch either again, I'd take the Garbo film, even though it's always good to watch Astaire and Charisse stepping out, so to speak.\n",
      "Those who think that Cole Porter and the Cold War make strange bedfellows aren't going to have their minds changed by this movie. It's a bizarre mishmash of MGM kitsch, Red-baiting, and homosexual archness, adapted from the stage musical. It also must be the dullest movie ever made in celebration of fun. I don't know what the stage version did (it's never revived) but this movie has one idea (Communism boring, Capitalism fun!) and it keeps beating us on the head with it while showing us around out a lot of Louis Whatever hotel suites that few Americans in 1957 could afford either. 1...2...3...what are we fighting for! (Money, evidently.) The propaganda would be more persuasive if Charisse didn't look sexier in her Worker's Black Nylons than she does in the silks that mark her transformation from dull comrade to fun capitalist-- and if those silks didn't actually appear to be nylons. <br /><br />For Komic Relief, there are Three Komrades-- they're the Three Stooges. The 'Ninotchka' (Charisse) is innocent of kissing-- she's like the native girls in '30s South Seas flicks. I guess they didn't do THAT behind the Iron Curtain. Perhaps the relevant passages were blacked out of her state translation of THE SUN ALSO RISES. We wait, and wait, and wait while Astaire sings and Janis Paige (she's trying to be Jean Hagen) chews the scenery, for Astaire and Charisse to dance. The dance numbers are very good and show off Astaire's unending quest to try out new ideas. Shame the rest of the movie didn't do so. <br /><br />This period piece is useful as a stored version of the Broadway show but it's watchable only if you occasionally use fast-forward.\n",
      "If it hadn't got caught up in the political rhetoric of the time. The propaganda of Russia - bad - and \"freedom\" - good - is so caricaturized, it is reminiscent of the awfully silly musical movie the main characters are producing in the film. Sometimes the music and dancing can save such a movie, but this one contains mostly snoozers and losers. The cast does a good deal for the picture, but they can't save it.\n",
      "Yeah, this is another somewhat typical \"big bad critters\" movie.<br /><br />Yet something is a little charming about this and the original Tremors. It's not intense or riveting... it won't keep you on the edge of your seat. But it's enjoyable to turn on while paying your bills or doing the dishes.<br /><br />Probably Michael Gross' acting and to some degree Susan Cuang's (nice and spunky - I liked her) made it enjoyable. The characters weren't deep but they were watchable, which is a lot more than can be said about a lot of stereotypical archetypes from Hollywood which TRY to be more.<br /><br />Nice, unassuming movie which doesn't try to be more than it is.\n",
      "Tremors 3: Back to Perfection starts in El Chaco in Argentina where Graboid expert & war nut Burt Gummer (Michal Gross) has been hired to wipe out an infestation of Shriekers. Upon his return to to Perfection Valley in Nevada where he lives Burt finds things have changed, Jack Sawyer (Shawn Christian) is running Graboid tours & a greedy property developer is trying to buy all the land in Perfection to build ranches. Then suddenly a new wave of Graboids appear, Burt warns the town & convinces them to help him kill them before they turn into Shriekers. However Federal Agents step in & forbid the killing of any Graboids due to the endangered species act which gives them the opportunity to become Shriekers & then after that stage they transform into yet another different type of creature which Burt has to deal with...<br /><br />Directed by Brent Maddock this was the second sequel to the excellent & likable 90's monster flick Tremors (1990) which is generally considered a bit of a classic, the sequels however thus far are a long way from classic status & while Tremors II: Aftershocks (1996) was decent enough Tremors 3: Back to Perfection continues the downward spiral of diminishing returns. The script follows Tremors II: Aftershocks quite closely with the initial Graboid reappearance & then about half way through just as in Tremors II: Aftershocks a new different type of creature is revealed & I don't quite know what to make of them to be honest. They look silly for a start & their ability to light their own farts to take off & fly is even more ridiculous in practice than in theory, the sight of them launching themselves off the ground using lighted farts is just as lowbrow & juvenile as it comes. I am not sure it if was done for comic effect or not but that's the impression that comes across & even calling them Ass Blasters says a lot about the mentality of the script & concept. As with Tremors II: Aftershocks things get out of hand & a bunch of survivors have to fight for their lives against the odds, you know the score. The chemistry between Kevin Bacon & Fred Ward was vital to the success of the original & while Ward came back for Tremors II: Aftershocks even he is missing form this & it's up to minor character Burt Gummer to step up to the plate & carry the film, to be fair he is quite amusing at times & at least his sidekick Jack Sawyer is quite likable & not some silly comic relief buffoon. There's nothing here we haven't seen before, the Shriekers are not seen at all apart from the opening sequence & at almost 100 minutes long it does drag at times & the constant silly humour & one liners does get tiresome & repetitive quite quickly.<br /><br />The lessening of the budget means that Tremors 3: Back to Prediction uses footage from the original Tremors & the CGI computer work isn't the worst around but it does look a bit shoddy at times especially when the main monster looks so silly. Apparently this was made as a way to sell the subsequent Tremors (2003) TV series which ran for thirteen episodes. A few character's from the original Tremors return here for a bit of novelty value, Nancy, Miguel & Melvin all reprise their roles. With the PG rating don't expect any gore & there's a low body count too.<br /><br />The production values are alright & it's well made, imagine a polished Sci-Fi Channel 'Creature Feature' & your not far off. The acting is OK, Michael Gross is amusing & has his character nailed down while the minor character's are all ably played.<br /><br />Tremors 3: Back to Perfection is alright for what it is, it's another creature feature with an especially silly creature, there are a few trademark Tremors moments & character's but you can see the series is getting a little bit tired. Followed by the TV series & Tremors 4: The Legend Begins (2004) while Tremors V: The Thunder from Down Under (2010) is listed as in production.\n",
      "As a real fan of Tremors 1 I made the mistake to trust all the good reviews on this site. But believe me guys: This one has nothing to offer (well - except a realy strange resurection scene). Unfortunately I bought the DVD. Don´t even rent it even if you feel greedy on a monster movie - watch Tremors No. 1 instead or get \"Octalus\" or whatever else there is on the shelve.\n",
      "This is loosely based on events that occurred during Frank Sinatra's tour of Australia where, after referring to a female reporter as a \"two-bit hooker\" he was black-banned by the local unions.<br /><br />Sadly, what could have been an interesting look at a clash of cultures, values and strong-willed individuals descends into something resembling a comedy sketch put on by a country repertory company.<br /><br />Dennis Hopper does a stirling job as Sinatra, with very little directorial support. After a while you start to believe he is Ol' Blue Eyes. But virtually all the other characters are painted in the broad brush strokes of low farce. <br /><br />Joel Edgerton plays the hapless promoter as a dim-witted surfer with a tendency to fall over or get beaten up in every second scene. Portia de Rossi is so loathsome in her role as the maligned journalist that I found myself cheering for Sinatra and the mob for most of the movie.<br /><br />And, in a masterstroke of bizarre casting and makeup, David Field blithely appears on screen looking about as much like Bob Hawke as my mum. Moreover, he seems to have made a conscious decision not to even attempt Hawke's accent, nor any of his well known mannerisms. The overall effect is as if the producers had decided to cast Dame Edna Everage in the role and hope that no-one would notice.<br /><br />Almost every Australian character in the film comes across as either a bumbling half-wit or a self-serving thug. I'm surprised Tourism Australia didn't try to have it banned. The sole exception is the delightful Rose Byrne who, as the love interest/voice of sanity, seems to have been beamed in from a parallel universe.<br /><br />Lamenting the state of the Australian film industry is a national pastime. I think much of it stems from the industry's long love affair with 'daggyness' for its own sake. Who finds this quirky and endearing any more? It's just embarrassing, and the rest of the world obviously thinks so too. This film, with its woeful dialogue, wooden 'school play level' direction, zero character motivation and absurd plot, admirably demonstrates the problem.\n",
      "When this opened in London - today - I attended the first performance and found myself alone. I had reservations just from the casting, I mean come on, Dennis Hopper, the epitome of hippie/rock playing Sinatra, the epitome of sophisticated cool? What next, Eminem as Cliff Richard. I hoped at least for a generous amount of Sinatra singing but even that was 1) strictly rationed and 2) performed by a Sinatra imitator and then, to add insult to injury, the end credits roll over Elvis Presley's Tutti Frutti. What passes for a plot centres on the infamous Australian tour of 1974 when Sinatra spoke his mind as usual and wound up a virtual prisoner in his hotel room until honour had been satisfied. A sub-plot that threatens to hi-jack the movie involves the young Rock promoter who brought Sinatra to Australia and a girl who had fancied him since they were kids. Basically we're talking rubbish. I thought Baz Lurhman's Moulin Rouge was about as low as you could get but here that Australian has competition from another. Dire.\n",
      "This is not an offensively bad or even plain bad film, it just isn't very good either.<br /><br />The performance from Joeol Edgerton is good enough, and Portia pulls off a good Ozzie accent but Dennis Hopper and Mel seem ridiculously badly cast and frankly (hehe) make you hate Frank Sinatra from the get go.<br /><br />The plot is slower than a sloth running through molasses and nothing really happens - no tension, no real antagonist/protagonist struggle, just bumbles through what I believe is a semi-accurate take on the 74 tour of Oz by Frank.<br /><br />If it's the only thing left on the shelf then it passes 2 hours, otherwise grab something else to spend your time with.\n",
      "ALL THE WAY (aka THE NIGHT WE CALLED IT A DAY) is a docudrama of sorts: it is based on a true incident that happened in Australia in 1974 and still is grumbled about today. Why this flimsy film was made in the first place seems only due to lasting resentments on the part of the Australians at the arrogant and crude behavior of Frank Sinatra when he made an appearance in Sydney during a world tour: he insulted the press, caused the labor unions to react in defiance by cordoning off his connection to the world outside his darkened hotel suite and demanded an apology from the star, an act that Sinatra refused to do.<br /><br />Writers Peter Clifton and Michael Thomas have attempted to make this boring incident viable by revealing the background events and characters surrounding the event. They have created Rod Blue (Joel Edgerton) as a failing show promoter who puts all his money and future into assuring the house for the concert. Australia loved Sinatra: this seemed his ticket to ride. Frank Sinatra (Dennis Hopper playing Dennis Hopper) arrives and one of the Press who alienates Sinatra is Rod's girl Hillary (Portia di Rossi) and when she asks inappropriate questions, Sinatra calls her a hooker and there begins the furor of the Aussies. The people are incensed at Sinatra's foul mouth and insensitivity and boycott the concert. The Labor Unions, representing the people of Australia, strike so that Sinatra is trapped in his hotel without light, water, food, room service, etc. Rod Blue's surefire scheme seems destined to fail.<br /><br />Sinatra is accompanied by his squad of hefty goons and his current paramour Barbara Marx (Melanie Griffith) and it is Barbara who intervenes and helps salvage the situation. She encourages Rod's mousy assistant Audrey (Rose Byrne) to believe in Rod whom she secretly loves and coerces Sinatra into negotiations with the people he has offended.Yes, it all works out in the end - Sinatra does his concert, Rod makes money and the audience appears satisfied and enthusiastic.<br /><br />Sound like a fairly boring film? Well, it is. It is partially saved by the entertainment of watching Hopper lip sync Sinatra songs as sung by Tom Burlinson, by Edgerton's commitment to make his hero Rod a credible human being, and by seeing Melanie Griffith looking terrific in beautiful gowns. Otherwise, despite the casts' best efforts, this is a forgettable film.\n",
      "I was extremely disappointed in this film.<br /><br />The acting was unconvincing, and the message of the film\"this could be everyone's century\"is glib and sweet enough to give one cavities.<br /><br />The dilemma between Gregory Peck's and Dorothy Maguire's characters could have been intriguing but it is so bogged down by a too-sappy-for-words love story that it never gets the chance.<br /><br />I can see that back in the 1947 this film would have been daring, which is probably why it won the Best Picture Oscar. But the historical value of the film did not save it for me. By the standards of what makes a classic, this film never manages to be more than mediocre.<br /><br />The only good things about this film are the scenes between Philip and his secretary (June Havoc delivers her shockingly hypocritical lines perfectly) and the fact that we get to see the handsome Gregory Peck a lot.\n",
      "The worst blue screen you'll ever see in a feature film. Dutched, off kilter camera angles, jerky, idiotic camera operation, poorly framed compositions, blown out exposures, thrown focus--you'd think between the \"DP\", the director and all the \"lighting assistants and ACs\" listed in the credits, one of these guys would know how to look at a digital viewfinder and compose a proper shot. A sound mix done by a deaf person, with FX simply missing, music overlay hoping to be mistaken as a sound design and so many poor dialogue recordings, you wished they would've used more of their poor-man's ADR. There is no talent here. None, only victims--the poor actors and actresses that got duped to be in this debacle. And technical problems aside, the film is the most wonderful example of complete self-indulgent, nonsensical, backwards, leap-of-faith egotism--how this Erwin guy got people to actually put themselves into this, I'll never understand. The only thing I could maybe understand is if Erwin used his casting sessions and \"principal photography\" as an elaborate Midwestern, adult-singles-dating service. That might explain something. Something . . .\n",
      "Vixen Highway looks someone got their friends together and decided to make a movie. The entire film is amateurish. Besides a bad script (was there a script?)and bad acting, parts of the films are overexposed, there are sound problems and the film editing was laughable. Most of the characters had no point to them and appeared to be thrown in just to take up space. Women, for no apparent reason, dressed provocatively; even a policewoman walking around with her shirt open. The only two who can act were Dave Quimby and the actor who played Bobby Brazzel (I notice that his character is not in the credits on IMDb, is it because he doesn't want to admit he was in it?) but even they couldn't shine in this mire of quicksand.\n",
      "Two Americans do unbelievable heroics just as France is being occupied by the Germans in the Second World War - and before the United States had entered the conflict. This is the sort of film that irritates some of us sensitive Brits, though your reviewer didn't mind Tyrone Power being in the RAF and Humphrey Bogart being at El Alamein. The duo depart on a highly dangerous mission (apparently involving a \"Satan bug\")with the minimal of briefing, exchange wisecracks as they descend into France by parachute, and link up with several gypsies, including a redundant girl.(Oh yes,the two are seen off by a senior officer who is driven up to their plane in a car with headlights blazing; presumably the Yanks didn't think the blackout applied to them.) The two manage to penetrate a high-security laboratory - and I do admit that they have a novel way of getting their explosives in. Everything then seems to go off with clockwork precision.<br /><br />The only redeeming features are some pleasant countryside and some good props - a couple of old vehicles and an impressive drainage system.\n",
      "This film lost all appeal for me when I started laughing about five minutes into it. Was that really the New York city skyline being used as a French seaport in 1940? The World Trade Centers were even there! We rewound and yes, that was supposed to be a French seaport in 1940. The film was made in 1978, the Towers completed in 1976. Really, really, really big mistake. I guess the audience wasn't supposed to be intelligent enough to know the difference.<br /><br />And that announcers' voice! What was up with that? I know he was providing background information but it was just plain annoying. We bought this for $5 thinking it was a good Tom Selleck movie. My comment to my husband was actually \"it's a Tom Selleck movie, it can't be all that bad\". It was that bad and even worse. Although after seeing the New York city skyline as France, we turned it off after we stopped laughing.\n",
      "I have to say that I did not watch the whole movie - I just couldn't! What with US army personnel parading around London in uniform before the US had entered the war; the stock footage of the 1970s era London Ambulance rushing the agent to the hospital; the \"military\" DC3 in civilian paint scheme; the Rolls driving around with headlights full on in the blackout; the \"French Port\" with lights blazing, also in the blackout; the \"Social Club\" in London that had both male and female members; the two \"heroes\" jumping out of the aircraft without a jump-master; and... Well, I could go on and on but I think you get the point. I just could not take this seriously and, in all fairness to the writers, I don't think it was meant to be taken seriously. But, you would have thought that they would have tried to make this wartime \"buddy\" movie a little more authentic. My advice is to not waste your time on this movie. Your time would be better spent sorting your sock drawer.\n",
      "In this uninspired, made-for-television, buddy picture, James Whitmore, Jr., and Tom Selleck portray two U.S. Army/Air Force officers ordered to destroy a winery in France that conceals a laboratory for the development of a lethal toxin that could wipe out half of the world in six months. Well-known writers Stephen J. Cannell of \"The A-Team\" and Philip DeGuere of \"Simon & Simon\" have contrived a formulaic, half-baked World War II secret mission behind enemy lines that is neither convincing nor exciting. The gimmick that the heroes rely on to deliver the explosives is the best idea in this lackluster adventure opus.<br /><br />This 77-minute melodrama spends its opening 14 minutes providing exposition to set up its plot. During that opening quarter hour, we are treated to an \"Untouchables\" style narrator and loads of second-unit shots mixed in with artwork and stock footage. We see a German E-Boator what passes for oneoff the French command intercept French radio signals. A fight between two agents ensues over possession of the toxin and the vial crashes into the floor and releases a nasty plume of smoke. The Allied agent suffers terribly while the German escapes. Eventually, doctors in England treat the Allied agent but he <br /><br />Our brash, fun-loving heroes parachute into France. Actually, Selleck's character boots Whitmore out of the plane and follows him down. A colorful band of traveling gypsies picks them up and serves as their cover during the trip to the winery. Our heroes have no money to pay for their escort so the gypsies appropriate Selleck's West Point ringyeah, right, what was he thinking when he brought it on this missionand Whitmore's watch. Little do they know that the Germans are racing ahead of them for the same destination. Perennial bad guy Albert Paulson commands the Axis intruders as a German colonel. Selleck masquerades as a German officer in order to enter the grounds of the winery. Whitmore taps into the communications line and calls ahead to German headquarters in the winery and inquires about an officer. The radio operator reports that no such officer is available. Whitmore complains that he should be notified to report back to him as soon as possible. This clever ruse helps Selleck effect entry since the Germans are expecting him. He fixes up things so that the plumbing backs up. The German colonel demands that the problem be dealt with in short order. Whitmore pretends to be a plumber taking a roadside break when German motorcycle troops discover his presence and escort him to the winery. As it turns out, this is exactly what our heroes want. Meantime, the Germans discover the gypsies in the woods, but they miss the strong man. He opens the water lines and sends metal tubes streaking through the lines. Inside the tubes are explosive devices. After he sends Whitmore all the explosive tubes, he drives his wagon off, only to be intercepted by German troops that take him prisoner. In the winery, Whitmore enters the vault where the vials of toxin chemicals are stored. Before he fiddles with the vials, he slips explosives to Selleck who has relieved the guards in front of the vault. Selleck and he set their charges and on the way out of the winery, they spot the gypsy father and daughter as well as the Germans escorting the strong man in the wagon.<br /><br />The last quarter hour involves their predictable heroics at rescuing the gypsies. Whitmore and Selleck succeed in their mission and the winery is blown sky-high. The \"Untouchables\" narrator furnishes us with a history lesson about the Italians declaring war on France and the Germans marching on Paris. <br /><br />Whitmore and Selleck play reasonably well off each other, but they are thwarted by embarrassing dialogue, especially when they are voicing themselves over in long shots. Veteran TV lenser Enzo A. Martinelli makes everything look good in this otherwise forgettable fare. Among the many anachronisms present here is Tom Selleck's haircut that was right for the 1970s but all wrong for 1940. I don't think that I've ever seen a German officer with a mustache the size of the one that Selleck wears. \"The Gypsy Warriors\" plays like a World War II version of the \"The Wild, Wild West\" with Whitmore doing all the dirty work and Selleck striking tough guy poses.\n",
      "The Laughing Dead is an incredibly cheesy low budget film without any value. It handles about a bus-load of social misfits (guided by a priest who lost his faith and impregnated a foxy nun) on a sightseeing tour around Aztec ruins in Mexico. There, they're awaited by a bunch of demons, zombies and mad-raving creatures in order to kill them during the 'Death Festival'. The first 45 minutes of 'The Laughing Dead' is very tedious viewing since they're presenting us a character drawing nobody really cares about. The priest and the nun are re-united and he learns he's the father of a bratty kid. There's no intrigue and the acting is very lame so the first half is very tough to sit through. After that, The Laughing Dead turns into a joyful splatter movie with cheesy make-up effects and a repulsive amount of blood. People's heads are chopped off (and used as a basketball), buses drive over torsos and one poor bastards even has his own arm shoved down his throat!! The film is bad and extremely amateurish, but there's a market for this kind of crap. So, if you're in to gory nonsense you can check this one out.\n",

      "I have seen a lot of films, including some of the more legendarily poor ones. But this, an alternative-stylee poor film, is infinitely worse than anything that I have ever seen in my entire life.<br /><br />I am not going to spoil it for you, but the end will make you think that you are under the influence of some form of halluconogenic substance. Not the frequently-mentioned baskebtall match, but there is another element that beggars belief, more so than any single event in any other film ever.<br /><br />There is so much that can be said about this film, but I'm going to keep it brief. If you can find it, get it. It is so bad it's pricelessly funny. I have been trawling the bad film archives for awhile now, and nothing can top this.<br /><br />Even if you have never delved into bad films before, try renting this, and prepare for the time of your life. It might sound like a hollow recommendation coming from one small man on the internet out there somewhere, but I guarantee when more people see this film, it will become a legendarily cult bad film, in the same way 'Troll 2' and 'Manos' are now. It deserves that status, but isn't popular enough, so I implore all bad horror fans and good comedy fans alike to search out this film and give it an opportunity, since it will change the way you view films forever.<br /><br />I've tried to omit spoiler content, because I fear that extended spoilers may ruin the fun! So go out, take a chance (just this once!) and pick up a copy of 'The Laughing Dead'.<br /><br />I guarantee you won't regret it, and I don't know what further guarantee I can give than that.\n",
      "i haven't felt so much pain just by gritting my teeth and sitting through a movie in a long, loooong time. i've seen worse movies - movies that were less inspired and movies that were more wholly inept - but only a handful, if that, were even nearly as painful. i think what really ruined this for me is that it had some vaguely good/okay concepts, but they were so horribly fleshed out that i just kept yelling at my vcr. the dialog was horrible, the acting was pretty damned bad, and the general premise was fairly weak (though if anything else had existed to keep this movie afloat, maybe it would have been salvageable).<br /><br />there's nothing i hate more than when characters in horror movies catch on too quickly, and these people were freaking savants in that regard, especially toward the end. oh, wait, there's one thing i hated more than that - the characters themselves! i've rarely seen a more unlikable bunch. i hated them all. even worse, the only two good actors (well actor and actress) in the film had the two most annoying characters out of all.<br /><br />the dialog hurts, it's so bad and so contrived (did i mention poorly delivered?). the only good points are 1) it ended before 90 minutes were up, and 2) the zombies, which appeared for about ten minutes at the end to play basketball, at least had good makeup. i don't think i can really give unmitigated credit to this movie for anything else.\n",
      "This is the 1hr 30min story about 4 guys that fell asleep watching a movie they never could imagine falling asleep to. Well this movie was all that it shouldn't be: 1.Good story 2.Good acting 3.Good special effects (well they weren't tha bad actually)Well anyway just a lame excuse for a movie, splatter movie, horror movie, you name it. The thing is: WE ALL FELL ASLEEP! Alright you get that? Not a good review for a movie when you can say that. 1/10\n",
      "I'm sorry to sound like a Scrouge, but this TNT film was a holiday stinker! <br /><br />The film's premise had good potential: From overseas, an American GI in World War II sends his high school sweetheart a marriage proposal and an engagement ring, which unfortunately are lost in the mail. When the letter and the ring are miraculously discovered forty years later, one would expect that the revelation would clear up the mystery and end the long-standing feud between two Italian families. <br /><br />But when Alicia (Lainie Kazan) learns about the letter and the ring sent by her former beau Nick (Tony Lo Bianco), her inexplicable response is to continue to be angry at him! This made no sense because it wasn't Nick's fault that the letter and the ring were lost. The subplot of the couple in the next generation (Patricia Heaton and Vincent Spano) also seemed forced and not believable. There were moments in this film that resembled French farce, then turned immediately into Greek tragedy!<br /><br />The dialogue was terrible, and the cast seemed to be reading their lines, as opposed to performing the action and connecting with each other in their relationships. I almost wished that the actors could have improvised the scenes around the basic romantic premise, instead of forcing the emotional life and giving us the impression that they were reading the insipid lines from cue cards. <br /><br />Before the film began, TNT offered this tagline as a teaser: \"The holidays are for bringing people together.\" As it turned out, that line was better than any of the scripted dialogue in the film, and the best character was the grandma mainly because she was mute!\n",
      "This thing makes Malibu's Most Wanted look like American Beauty. I'm being generous in giving it a 3, but only because I chuckled a few times at some of the 80's references. This movie has one thing going for it, Michael Rosenbaum. He is incredibly funny in it, and I'm sure most of his stuff was improvised, because it's the only bright spot in a badly directed, badly lit, badly everything turkey that should've been released in January or February. Rosenbaum has fun with his role, and he even manages to reference Oliver Stone's 'The Doors' if you can believe it. Skip it and put it on your Netflix list if you're really bored.\n",
      "The way I figure it, it takes about a good twenty years for a decent nostalgia trend to kick in. That's just about the point at which the youngsters of a particular era will have experienced enough of adult life to start them pining away for the \"good old days\" of their pleasantly carefree and invariably misspent youth. In the 1970's, audiences escaped back to the more innocent and halcyon days of the 1950's through works such as \"American Graffiti\" and \"Happy Days,\" while in the '80's, it was the '60's that got replayed, via \"The Wonder Years\" and \"The Right Stuff.\" In a similar way, \"That '70's Show\" came to define nostalgia for the young adults of the '90's. Now, apparently, it is the '80's that are making a comeback, as those who were kids in that decade begin to edge their way ever so reluctantly into middle age. That's where the comedy, \"Kickin' it Old Skool,\" comes in.<br /><br />The premise of the movie is as follows: in 1986, a ten-year-old named Justin Schumacher suffered a concussion at one of his break dance competitions that left him in a coma for twenty years. When he finally returns to consciousness two decades later, he discovers, much to his dismay, that the world has moved on without him, and that everything that was once important and familiar to him - from the fashions to the technology to the music - is now hopelessly \"un-cool\" and out-of-date. After he learns that his parents will soon be going bankrupt if they can't find a way to pay for all the medical expenses they incurred while caring for their comatose son, Justin convinces his old break dancing buddies to come out of retirement and enter a contest, the winners of which will receive a whopping $100,000 in prize money.<br /><br />There really is very little point to \"Kickin' it Old Skool\" beyond providing an opportunity for us to laugh at all those pop culture trends and icons that we thought were so cool at the time but that seem merely quaint and funny to us today. Thus, we get the big hair, the head bands, the glitter, the parachute-pants, the synthesizer-laden music, the boom boxes, the Michael Jackson moves, the \"What yu' talking' 'bout, Willis?\" quips that, for some at least, have come to define the era. Unfortunately, that is hardly a sufficient foundation upon which to build a quality movie, and \"Kickin' it Old Skool\" ultimately emerges as a wan, not-very-funny cross between \"Footloose\" and all those inexplicably popular flicks in which a youngster mysteriously wakes up in an adult person's body. Although it's genial and harmless, \"Kickin' it Old Skool\" suffers even more in comparison to a movie like \"Superbad,\" which is a truly whip-smart and astutely observant study of what it means to be a dork or a misfit in a society that values appearance and coolness above all else. Moreover, Jamie Kennedy is clearly no Jonah Hill or Michael Cera in the acting department. In fact, with his pratfalls, clowning and mugging, he often seems to be channeling a bad imitation of Jerry Lewis.<br /><br />Even though David Hasselhoff and Emmanuel Lewis stop by for a couple of good-natured cameos, this is one fish-out-of-water tale that should probably be thrown back in the water.<br /><br />At best, the movie makes one wonder how audiences twenty years from now will be looking back at the 00's. One shudders at the thought.\n",
      "I generally like Jamie Kennedy and thought Malibu's Most Wanted was pretty funny. But holy crap, this movie was a pile of ****.<br /><br />They had a great premise to build on and they blew it. Could have had cameos all over the place, Turbo and Ozone from Breakin', Kool Moe Dee, Grandmaster Flash, etc etc.<br /><br />Instead, they put in a bunch of Busch league dancers who were flat out annoying, and jokes written with zero creativity. It reminds me of another turd that came out recently, Drillbit Taylor.. Annoying characters, a script that wouldn't pass a 5th grade Creative Writing paper, with a few people that *could* have been funny (and are in other movies).<br /><br />At minimum it should have been funny and it should have had some ridiculously good breakers and it failed miserably on both counts.<br /><br />I'm being kind by giving it 4/10.\n",
      "When people make movies as bad as this, do they attend their premieres? I really wanna know. How do they show their faces? I guess \"comedies\" like KICKIN' IT OLD SCHOOL must appeal to some kind of illiterate unschooled trailer-trash drool-toothed dipsticks, otherwise somebody fellated some major pole to get this greenlighted.<br /><br />Was it the minimal \"draw\" of comedians Jamie Kennedy and Bobby Lee (both naturally funny guys, but atrocious in this movie)? Was it the anachronistic break dancing craze, a proved cash cow in the distant past? Was it that comet that passed near Earth and birthed a two-headed calf? <br /><br />The fish-out-of-water premise always has potential: Justin (Alexander Calvert), a hot young breakdancer in the 80s, lands on his head and goes into a coma. He wakes 20 years later (retaining his 14-year-old mentality, which explains why he is now Jamie Kennedy) and reunites his break dancing team from the old days - Miguel A. Núñez Jr., Bobby Lee and Aris Alvarado, losers all, who can't dance any more, let alone act. <br /><br />They enter a dance comp for some inane reason, but Justin's agenda is to show his ex-girl (Maria Menounos) he can still kick it, so she will leave her asshole boyfriend (Michael Rosenbaum) for him. It could have worked, had this movie hired an actual director, actual writers and actual actors.<br /><br />What irks about KICKIN' IT OLD SCHOOL is that, like many movies of its lowbrow ilk, stupidity and non-talent is lauded. It is not a bad thing that Our Heroes \"win\" the day, but that they win without any effort; they win when others are so clearly superior; they win by being the biggest retards on stage - and that is supposedly how you win. No, kids. It's not. Even this bad movie (and others like it) is not made by people who DON'T know what they're doing. Yet this movie tells us a competition can be won if you don't know what you're doing; it tells us that all those years of practice for the other competitors counts for nothing; it tells us you can be a virtuoso at a craft without going through the rigors of becoming a virtuoso. (Like those bogus exercise-machine ads that claim, \"You don't even break a sweat!\" Hey, great! No pain AND gain!) And that's entirely unacceptable.<br /><br />The funny thing about this movie (--there's something funny about this movie?) is that Bobby Lee's \"Domo Arigato Mr. Roboto\" bit looks hilarious in the trailers, in the film, like a Chinese burn. So too with the down-wid-it tongue-in-cheek title, all the failed gags, embarrassing plot points and mistimed bits. Nothing works outside of the thirty-second trailer.<br /><br />What almost became an Olympic sport in the 80s has been marginalized in the 2000s, but the people who still do it, do it extremely well. And that's the only redeeming factor in this movie - the dancing. Dated though it is stylistically, we appreciate the astounding expertise of the kids who can still jam, break, lock, snap, crackle and pop it.<br /><br />Unfortunately, expertise is something Jamie Kennedy and his crew of jackasses lack, so we know how it's going to end - yes, he wins the dance comp, gets the girl, and somewhere, Gene Kelly, Fred Astaire and Gregory Hines are turning in their graves.<br /><br />--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).\n",
      "I wasn't going to write a review but I had to do something when I discovered IMDb has nothing lower than 1 star.<br /><br />I am absolutely floored by the fact that 455 people gave this movie 10 stars. I can only assume that they were investors who are trying to salvage whatever they can by tricking naive readers into going to see this total disaster. I caught this on cable (nothing else on) and my jaw dropped minutes after it started and I kept watching because I truly could not believe it could get worse. Man, was I wrong! I had seen the previews, thought it had potential and considered seeing in a theater. Pfffew.<br /><br />The scenes with Maria Menounos are priceless. She absolutely deserves some kind of award for that performance. In the same way IMDb needs to add a zero rating for this specific movie, the Oscars need a brand new category for the role of Jennifer in Kicking It Old Skool. In fact, I've just decided to coin the acronym KIOS and use it whenever I see someone who is acting the way Maria acts in this movie.<br /><br />I feel sorry for anyone who spent any money watching this movie. And to the 455 investors, your 10 star ratings were totally KIOS.\n",
      "I just saw this movie, and I regret it badly. I hoped for a good nice comedy, that would make me laugh, and give me a nice feeling after watching it. <br /><br />With this movie I didn't get that. MOST of the jokes was to lame for my taste, and not very fun. As the movie progressed my final grade became lower and lower, almost ended up at 1, which is the lowest grade. The only good thing about the movie was the Knight Rider scene, only because of that, and some SMALL laughs it get's 2 stars instead of 1. Also I wanna point out that the acting in this movie is not very good. Some scenes I find vulgar, and very disturbing. Not fun at all, you kinda wait now here comes the joke, and then there just comes nothing.<br /><br />If you think about watching this movie, my advice to you is don't watch it.<br /><br />2/10 stars\n",
      "I rarely hate films; in fact the only other film I have been genuinely annoyed at having subjected myself to watching was date movie. Personally I find it hard to distinguish between the two as to which is worse. this is just so terrible. the acting is awful, the script is unfunny and, putting it bluntly, crap, the humour is that of a 9 year old, the plot line is rubbish and the whole movie is such an utterly pitiful attempt at a comedy. IT IS A WASTE OF TIME TO EVEN BOTHER WATCHING THIS. FOR YOUR OWN SAKE, DO NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT IT!!!!!<br /><br />Here are the facts how I see them:<br /><br />1. I watch a lot of films<br /><br />2. I am very tolerant of films and rarely dislike them<br /><br />3. I passionately, from the depths of my heart, hate this movie.<br /><br />4. However pointless, I hate the producers and writers of this film for making such a Appalling movie, and even more for subjecting it to the public.<br /><br />I will repeat again, DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!\n",
      "Throughout the movie, I found myself uncomfortably irking in my seat hoping to fast forward the scene because of too much stupidity in it. The plot was supposed to have made a good film but destroyed with all the bad scripts, acting , bad humors, and so many pathetic scenes. The only part that made appeal to me was the first part, the 80s setting. Those kids acted it well enough. Also, there's too much inconsistency -- the young justin has acted good as a cool kid in school but the old justin is such a gigantic loser. <br /><br />Michael Rosenbaum is such a greatactor and he shouldn't have been casted in this movie, this destroys his reputation.<br /><br />Please don't make stupid film like this again. It's such a waste of time.\n",
      "In a moment of self-vindication, Jamie Kennedy's love interest tells him that the most beautiful part about him is that he doesn't try to act like an adult. Therein lies the fault of Kickin' It Old School, its assumption that there is something virtuous in acting like a 13 year old, and an immature one at that, especially when it's writers are thirty something, and throwing their best material into the mix. To that end, Jamie Kennedy pulls out every trick in the book including fat jokes, gay jokes, racial slurs, bathroom humor, sex jokes, violence, Jewish jokes, retard jokes, a barrage of un-funny parodies of 80's wardrobe, dated colloquialisms, and over-played and un-original jokes resulting from a 20 year coma in a tragic attempt to mix back to the future, you got served, and some Adam Sandler movie. The abundant product placements and celebrity cameos makes it clear that Kennedy tried as hard to fund this film as he did to make it funny, calling in every favor and taking every opportunity to give a product unnecessary and often distracting camera time. For a film with so much corporate backing, one might expect camera and lighting work that was at least decent enough not to detract from an already lacking project. Luckily, the guest stars in the film didn't have much reputation to loose, since the product of their efforts is nothing short of a cataclysmic failure. Somewhere between a fat joke and a TiVo plug, there's an uninteresting and hackneyed plot about a desperate loser who has to do something big to win something back, imagine Happy Gilmore but with humor replaced with break dancing. This is what you'll get from Kennedy's Kickin' it Old School which features Kennedy as an adolescent boy in a 30-year-olds body who has just woken up from a 20 year coma to find out that the world has changed and has wholly passed him by. He must reunite his dance team and win a break dancing competition to pay off expensive medical bills and save his house, win the girl back from his evil nemesis, etc. etc. Perhaps Kennedy lost me when he started rubbing his fat best friends breasts, thankfully covered in a bra, but it seems that he often forgets which subplot he's working with, or rather what the main plot is altogether. If Kennedy seems convincing as a man with a 13-year-old mind, which he does not, it may be due to the fact that his humor never quite developed past a pubescent mentality. Maria Menunos seems oddly overwhelmed by a role that really should have been easy to pass off just on good looks. Kennedy himself is erratic, immature, and awkward with unkempt hair that parallels the movies and Kennedys lost sense of direction. Miguel Nunez Jr. revives the awkwardness that defeated Juana Man some years ago, a film with a plot and a performance about as disappointing as this one. Bobby Lee slips in and out of a stereotypical Asian parody that becomes MIT alum when he whips out his big vocabulary words, he is much more effective and funny in sketch comedy when he is no forced to extend his performance for more than five minutes. Michael Rosenbaum is refreshingly comedic in the light of his feeble co-stars. At one point in the film, Kennedy's character comments that his dancing crew is just a bunch of 30 year old guys acting like losers since they are stuck in a 13 year old mentality, This proves to be the most interesting moment in the film since the viewer is left to wonder whether the dialogue pertains to the plot only or is perhaps an introspective excursion for Kennedy himself. If it is, the 30 year old loser wins in the end, so Kenned can be seen as optimistic at best. If there seem to be too many suicide or death jokes in the movie, perhaps Kennedy is recognizing his failure and subtly suggesting something to the audience, were all ears. Ultimately, the audience is left wishing that Kennedy's character had not come out of a coma, or at least that they could be put into one for the remainder of the film.\n",
      "Yep! \"Stuuuuupid\", thats what you got to be to go see this piece of junk.<br /><br />Acting -> Stinks Direction -> Stinks Jokes -> so badly setup you see them coming a mile away, some oldies might smile a couple of times thinking back... but thats it, nothing really funny the whole damn movie.<br /><br />Overall, made really cheap and it shows.<br /><br />I am willing to bet my, and my future kids testicles in saying this is going to flop SO badly because you have to be an utter moron to like a movie like this, even taking into consideration that there are many morons out there... this would be too much for a large majority of them too.\n",
      "I'd heard Jamie Kennedy was funny. Whoever reported that was on crack. Kennedy makes Pauly Shore seem like Laurence Olivier.<br /><br />I brought my 2 sons (11 and 13) to see this movie because one thought it looked funny. I'm a pushover for going to movies with them. I figure a movie with a PG-13 rating will not be crude or offensive, simply it will have a few curse words and possibly some implied sex.<br /><br />I think I laughed once and thought my sons were laughing a little early on. When they got to the part about teaching the formerly comatose break dancer some moves for getting with his love interest (using a short fat Hispanic \"actor\" with a wig and bra as a sex doll -- he looked like Chewbacca with that wig. They showed him how to grope and squeeze his \"boobs\".), I was utterly offended because of what my children were seeing. I was about to tell my family we were leaving, when my 11 year old asked, \"Can we GO, now?\" <br /><br />The rating was wrong. There should be a rating for offensive, insulting, pointless, no redeeming values. I only wish I had seen a manager on my way out so I could have gotten a refund. This is only the second movie I have ever walked out on in my life.<br /><br />I agree with several of the other reviewers. I felt that my evening out was worse than ruined (we bought 4 tickets, 2 drinks and a tub of popcorn -- easily $40). Time was stolen from us. If I were a fighting man, I would already have beaten the crap out of the people who released this movie. I also agree that the positive comments could only be coming from people who made money on the movie, or who are friends. This ca-ca stinks. \"Lex Luthor\" Rosenbaum was fine in it. Christopher MacDonald must have been paid a lot to stoop this low. The love interest was good looking.<br /><br />GARBAGE GARBAGE GARBAGE. I'm getting mad just thinking about how awful it was and how much it cost for that lesson. I will never watch a Jamie Kennedy movie again, unless he's uncredited and I didn't know he was in it. If this movie comes on TV and you have a chance to run away, do so. I'd rather watch a political debate with toothpicks under my fingernails.\n",
      "I saw it tonight, and do yourself a favor and read what I say here. This movie goes way beyond simply being a waste of time and money - I feel that almost two hours of my life have been MURDERED. I try to have a policy of not walking out of movies because I can usually find something good about them. I am as forgiving as an audience can be, but once I had finally had enough of this one, I had a headache from the anger it caused me. Without going into specifics about the multitude of things that were bad, I will tell you that the hack writers and producers should be arrested and sued for trying to make money from something that puts the world in reverse and robs us of our time on earth ...they even had the gall to make it more than 90 minutes. I could have put up with the poor story and the awful characters if the jokes or the actors were funny, but they weren't. I'm a peace and love kind of guy, but right now, four hours after seeing this, I find myself still wanting to fly to LA to find Jamie Kennedy and kick his ass. Anyone who gave this a good review has got to be on the payroll of the production company. I have to stop writing because I'm finding that words can't describe what an awful experience it truly is.\n",
      "this movie has no redeeming qualities at all...none...it is insulting and worst of all it isn't funny. For example, it makes fun of an elderly homeless man, then offers up as comedy a picture of that man peeing on himself. It has a horrible stereotype of Black women bullying and beating up on their men and the men being afraid of their women. When I saw the film it didn't draw one laugh from the audience that was watching it...not one. It was a pathetic, humorless, offensive and stupid endeavor. The only partially redeeming characteristic of this film is that if you get up to go to the snack bar in the middle of the film you won't miss anything funny or important. Do NOT see this film!\n",
      "This movie was utterly obnoxious. All the jokes were trite, slapstick humor and could be seen a mile away. The acting was stilted at best and downright awful at worst. It was overdone both acting wise and in the direction. Not that one would expect greatness from a Jaime Kennedy movie but I thought it would at least be entertaining. Unfortunately, this was not the case. It was the worst movie I have ever sat through at the theater. Had I paid money instead of seeing a special screening I would have demanded a refund after ten minutes. Don't bother spending your money on this film, wait three months, it will be out on cable its that bad.\n",
      "Just when you thought the nail couldn't be pushed any deeper into his coffin, Kennedy is back, and this time in a movie like Malibu's Most Wanted, or rather a movie where he is acting like a stupid white guy: Kickin It Old Skool! Right now I'm telling you just to rent Malibu's Most Wanted to get a clear picture of how this movie is: humorless with a stupid white protagonist. You don't even have to go out and spend a few bucks on a rental, just turn on your TV at this moment, and you will find a movie with the same formula.<br /><br />The only handful of at least entertaining films Kennedy have been in is \"Dead Poets Society\", for which he was uncredited, \"Boogie Nights\" which wasn't in the original film but deleted scenes, and Scream where his character was well balanced among the other high school kids in the film. His track record of Son of the Mask and Max Keeble's big movie, considered his biggest roles along with MMW weren't too great.<br /><br />The best part of the film was the secondary characters, who dished out some occasional amusing humor from time to time. But the humor didn't last long when it cut right back to a joke about stupid white Jaimie Kennedy, just to ruin the good mood! <br /><br />The story is oh-so familiar, with a rival young hip group of kids just waiting to duke it out with Kennedy and his band of misfits, except duke it with fists they shall not, but rather their old skool moves. (Notice how the title of the film is spelled adequately for our youth of today, missing all sorts of hard consonants that we shouldn't bother with putting in proper linguistics).<br /><br />Alas, there could have been hope. But don't waste your money on yet another film attempting to exploit the goofy white people, which has been done for years on end.<br /><br />Kennedy needs to stay in his coma, for the better.<br /><br />3\n",
      "This was terrible.<br /><br />With the amount of talent and experience the team has, I am amazed that they produced such a poor example of \"Science Fiction\". Besides lacking any true originality or mystery, the characters and events utterly failed to be believable. The plot is furthered by leaps and bounds of crooked logic and the musical score tries too hard to compensate for it. I felt that I was watching a cheap ripoff of an episode of Outer Limits (which itself is not a fantastic example of the genre). When I started watching, I hoped to be intrigued and forced to think. Unfortunately, the message was insultingly obvious.\n",
      "The first episode of this series was a ham-fisted political statement with little merit. Viewing of the second episode ultimately left the same impression as the first. While initially promising, and a much better use of actors and a wider, more involving setting, this episode succumbed to the same preachy, heavy-handed political dogma that marred the first one. In fact, this episode was less subtle, more absurd and more strident in it's denouncement of US policy, as well as naive and unrealistic about other nations' motives.<br /><br />The setup is that an all-powerful force comes to Earth to stop warfare, promote understanding (via language translation), and ultimately create a peaceful world. Of course we are privy to this intent because we are told so by the plot, while characters in the story are given bits and pieces. This force eventually leads the world to the brink of destruction as it shuts down Earth's nuclear weapons in a sequential manner. The world's leaders must decide whether to attack the extraterrestrial forces or submit to being disarmed. A discussion about the motives of the ETs follows, are they benevolent or hiding ulterior motives? Who knows?<br /><br />Unfortunately, the denouement of this intriguing setup involves the use of a heavy hammer to pound the tired message that US imperialism ruined the world while Soviet and Chinese socialistic benevolence could save it. This is being stated by those who hate the US political administration and policy, and have a unrealistically rosy view of other big nations. These are the same individuals who would NOT get to make such a statement about their government but would be imprisoned if they were living in these other nations, or would be slaughtered for such statements if living under an extremist Islamic government.<br /><br />Are we to believe that both China and Russia would so graciously accept disarmament by a force seen as \"God\", an entity that both governments have denied for years? Is it realistic that a US President and his military staff would actually announce to these same nations what their plans of defense would be? Is it also realistic that an all-powerful extraterrestrial force would only be able to shut down nuclear arms in sequence rather than all at once? Isn't it sensible that the military staff would warn the President that the ET forces may have unkind motives? Did nobody here see the Twilight Zone episode, To Serve Man?<br /><br />The scene of the US President, of course played by the Smoking Man from X-files, being lectured by the Chinese \"President\" (who in reality is actually NOT a president) about humanity was laughable. Yes, we all know that China is a staunch defender of human rights. The Chinese have so much more freedom from tyranny than we, especially their protesting students. The only realistic moment in this whole scenario was when the French agree to capitulate to the ETs, and then that was made into a joke by having the US react to that with surprise. Forget this tripe and rent or buy a copy of The Day the Earth Stood Still, a better version of this idea.<br /><br />Note to the writers and producers of this series: We already know what happens when an extraterrestrial force arrives looking like a \"God\" and appears to be benevolent, and are welcomed. If you are curious about this, just research these terms = MAYAN CIVILIZATION and CONQUISTADORS\n",
      "Wow, that was awful! My fiancée(who has aided me in several other recent reviews of mine) and I watched this last night, and the quality was so low, we decided to write a review of it together... to warn off anyone lucky enough to not have watched it yet. No, the \"documentary\"-maker may not have had a direct hand in creating(nay, *spawning*) this episode, but it sure reeks of him. The story was preachy and condescending, not to mention poorly structured(essentially entirely built up around the political agenda that it forces upon us for a good deal of it). Another trait that fits with him having made it is the blatant anti-Americanism. No matter your stance in politics, no matter how you feel about the agenda pushed here, the presentation is undeniably extremely poor... which is really the very core of the problem with this. The message was heavy-handed, preachy(*at* you, not even to you) and insulting. This made After School Specials look subtle and Jerry Springers' Final Thought look intelligent. It's not so much Masters of Science Fiction as Masters, if even that, of Left Wing Propaganda. The acting was unimpressive, save for perhaps O'Quinn(whose presence in the episode, coupled with our attraction to the genre of science fiction were largely the reasons we watched the episode), but Rohm, for example, is just... bad. Why she keeps being cast is a mystery. Editing was OK, cinematography had moments that made me wish the director would pursue music videos, instead. The special effects seemed as if they wanted to save any money they could... save for one effect, which was good, and another, which seemed to have no purpose at all. The writing is quite lousy... clichés are plentiful, it was drenched in naivety, predictability abounds, the story never really captivates(in spite of its title, I could easily see people falling asleep during it), even though it manages to rip off far more established sci-fi titles(including Independence Day and The Day The Earth Stood Still... the latter being from when obvious messages in this genre were at least more accepted and usual, and actually a well-produced piece of celluloid; this was simplistic, offensive... modern propaganda). The writer/director seems to have also taken a note from X-Files(in addition to promoting The Cigarette Smoking Man to President), in leaving the ending open(to appease and appeal to both religious people and UFO enthusiasts... and here's hoping they'll all see right through it). The score was... strange. I'm not sure who thought those drums were a good idea. The production values aren't dreadful. The President and Americans, particularly military officials, all come off as war-mongers(the throwaway line about the fallout, oh *please*). The good guys are all the other countries, in this piece of pap. How was this even sci-fi? Heck, it could easily be argued that there is nothing that would bring about that classification to be found at all. Ignore the promos. Please. For your own good. And these are the \"masters\"? These episodes, the cream of the crop(since they were the ones ABC *chose* to air, there were two they didn't",
      "what must they have been like)? Somehow, early parts aren't devoid of promise... the first scene with O'Quinn actually has some dialog and points that were interesting, and the first episode, \"A Clean Escape,\" did at least show some quality to it. The only value this has is to be laughed at. We want our hour back. It should be noted that we only got to see these first two episodes, as our local ABC affiliate chose to air pre-season football instead of the two episodes following it... and ABC buried it in a spot in the summer, when they would be watched by hardly anyone. I recommend this only to those who agree with the message being shoved down the throats of viewers... so the preaching can go no further than the ears of the choir... and those who are fans of science fiction and/or Terry O'Quinn should especially stay away. Far, far away. And to the people behind this sorry excuse for entertainment and/or commentary: Guys... get on a soap-box and stay away from this fine medium(or, as my fiancée suggested, stick to message boards, so you can be put on Ignore). We don't need more sci-fi *this* badly. In case you were wondering if my fiancée and I hated this... yes. Yes, we did. We wish we could give this a zero, but... 1/10\n",
      "I'm a huge Zappa fan, but this is easily one of the worst movies I've ever seen, right next to Star Wars The Phantom Menace. Frank and company should have taken a cue from the Beatles' Magical Mystery Tour and realized that you just can't shoot random weirdness and expect to have a watchable movie.<br /><br />The music's just ok, too. This version of the Mothers with Flo and Eddie was never one of my favorites. Still, the film does kind of suck you in and dares you to watch it. Some of the really old and cheeseball special effects, reverse film tricks, etc. come off as disturbing, but all in all, this is quite a snooze.\n",
      "To many people, musician Frank Zappa's counterculture rants were dangerous, to some sexually charged and stimulating, and still to others tired and boring. Somehow, he managed to cut a deal with United Artists and filmed what emerged as a free-form musical diatribe on drugs, sex, the gap between generations (musicians vs. the common businessman) and post-psychedelic expression. With MTV some 10 years off, this was the only way Zappa and his Mothers (of Invention) could bring their ideas together, but unfortunately it's too messy to involve anyone beyond Zappa's core audience. Ringo Starr, in Frank Zappa garb, has some curious speeches that attempt to clarify Zappa's concepts of society, and some of the rock music is indeed exciting, but Frank Z. is far too defensive to be much fun. Surely some of these directionless scenes are meant to be satiric, but his sense of humor is always undermined by a draggy, self-serious need to \"teach us something\". It's a post-\"Laugh In\" series of sketches which might've been personally felt out, but they fail to grab hold because, technically, they look terrible. Grungy, and undermined by druggy influences, the movie doesn't take shape. Besides, Bob Rafelson and the Monkees did this kind of thing first (and more slickly, to involve a wider audience) with \"Head\" in 1968.\n",
      "After over 30 years of waiting, I finally caught this movie on late-night cable. It was definitely not worth the wait. As expected, FZ fanatics will dub virtually anything he did as a \"work of genius,\" but this nasty piece of work is nothing more than a display of self-indulgence. FZ himself stays out of the limelight, using Ringo as his stand-in, but he hovers in the background as a God- or conductor-figure, the mastermind behind the mess. The film is choppy, vulgar, and so dead-weighted by 70s film techniques that it's a laughable look back at how awful entertainment could be in those days. And the band...aargh! Would anyone like to argue that the Turtles could never have made it in show biz after the advent of video? And why does the amazing George Duke waste all his time with a trombone? Zappa was no doubt a musician of talent and insight. For instance, I remember reading an article he wrote in STEREO REVIEW (around this same time) about the music of French avant-garde composer Edgard Varese. And he obviously was acquainted with current orchestral writing techniques (the segments in the film of purely orchestral music are the most durable). But what separates him from true genius is how he wasted his career trying to shock the cultural and religious establishment by being as crude and vulgar as possible. Many \"geniuses\" have shocked the world, but few if any of them spent their careers reveling in the muck as did Zappa. Genius requires something a bit more exalted than 200 MOTELS.\n",
      "I've been reading about it for years. I got to finally watch it. It's absolute rubbish.<br /><br />I'm not to happy with what I said because criticizing something doesn't mean attacking it or cursing it. And I'm a big Zappa fan. I listened to most of his music, read about him, read his book, watched almost all of his videos. I'm not fond of his dark egotistical sexually-obsessed cynical obnoxious side. I'm more for his unique, innovative, independent, genius, creative, pleasant musical side. <br /><br />He was intelligent. He was an articulate speaker. A funny man. <br /><br />He's not a god. And he's definitely not a filmmaker.<br /><br />The film is just boring. I lost interest after struggling with it for 1 hour. And it's not like I'm not open-minded or I don't understand. I like surrealism, absurdity, and the avant-garde. But the film was just tasteless.\n",
      "While not truly horrible, this movie is still a nearly unwatchable mess which is only barely saved by Zappa's music.<br /><br />This movie could only have been made in the post-psychedelic, highly experimental climate of the early 70s. It feels like a first year film school project gone horribly wrong. Every \"trippy\" video and editing trick is employed. It's truly an \"everything but the kitchen sink\" approach to film making, however, it only serves to compound the fact that there's no substance to this mess. There's no plot to speak of, rather it's more of a series of skits. The trouble is, for the most part they're unfunny and only barely entertaining. Even cameos by such luminaries as Ringo Starr and Keith Moon fail to deliver much beyond the cheap thrill of recognition.<br /><br />As I mentioned, this movie is only barely saved by the musical performances. That's because some of them are horrible, some are just OK, and only a select few are actually really good. This is the kind of movie you need to see on DVD so you can skip straight to the performances, because there's really no other reason to watch this movie.<br /><br />I guarantee you won't be able to get through this movie in one sitting. It's basically garbage, and is interesting mainly as a historical curiosity.\n",
      "There probably aren't a lot of people out in imbd land that are bigger Zappa fans than I am (I have ALL of his records for starters), but even so this film just doesn't do it for me. Others who are big fans of this late genius may want to give this one a look for curiosity or nostalgic purposes, but as a cohesive films it leaves a lot to be desired. It'd probably be great to have on if one were to be, say, experimenting with hallucinogenic mind altering substances, but other than that it leaves a lot to be desired. I recall about 10 minutes of entertaining segments in this long production and again, I'm a HUGE Frank Zappa fan. Thankfully there's more suitable footage available for those who want to see what this often underrated musician was really like. Then again, I've always thought Zappa was ahead of his time musically and philosophically, so perhaps this somewhat dated production will be more appreciated in years to come. Like his music, though, there's certainly not many other things out there like this. Sorry, Frank, but I still have to give this one a 2 out of 10. Long live Zappa!\n",
      "I saw this film for the first time in the 70's in a funky little theater in Manhattan on a double bill with Joe Cocker/Leon Russell's \"Mad Dogs And Englishman\". I was stone cold sober. Now, TCM just broad casted it and I watched it again. This film is full of little vignettes about life on the road, but the images are deliberately blurred, the camera goes here and there, and everyone seems to be partaking in something that they bought from a dealer. This, of course, is ironic, since Frank Zappa did not do drugs. Some of the music is, of course, wonderful, and its great to see people like Flo and Eddie, Ian Underwood and Jimmy Carl Black on screen, but the film is solely for Zappa fans. I don't think you need to get stoned to watch it, but for some of this, if you are sober you feel like you were invited to a party only to be the resident wallflower. If you like Zappa, who of course left us too soon, you owe it to yourself to watch it, but if you do not care for his music, its not your film. The rating is based on the cohesiveness of the film, which is barely there. I was stone cold sober when I watched it on television this time also. I'll never learn.\n",
      "This bizarre, trippy experience has a few good songs and a couple of laughs. It is also incomprehensible, boring, and silly. The band proves they should stay on the infamous road, and away from the camera, and this is nothing more than a Frank Zappa ego trip. \"200 Motels\" gets an appropriate 2.\n",
      "This was always going to be a hard novel to adapt - the very qualities that make it a great read make a confusing film. The book has a mysterious, dream-like, languid quality - Woolf can slip over hundreds of years in a sentence and the reader admires her prose skill and absolute razor conciseness.<br /><br />On the screen though a jump of that kind, with no explanation, is just confusing. We detect from early on in the book that it's more of a psychological fable set against a literary / historical background than a naturalistic, historical story with a real plot. But on film all the realistic period detail etc taken in by your eye makes you instinctively expect realistic events. Might have been a better film if done like a Greenaway, so clear to the viewer it's not a 'realistic' story etc. Or if completely re-interpreted, or turned into a feminist polemic - by just translating as closely as possible events from the book to screen it's just thin and pointless. Plus many long, silent, madness-inducing pauses in the film, which obviously you don't get in a book.<br /><br />There's simply no 'story' in the film, no reason to care, and the only character seen long enough to register is Tilda Swinton's Orlando, who as a distant, expressionless, apparent immortal you just can't care about. We don't even get to know 'what it's like' to be Orlando, and there's no interest in the whys and wherefores of his/her immortality - so no 'threat', no 'learning', no story arc of any kind. All in all I can't recommend the book highly enough (plus it's really thin!) but don't bother with the film.\n",
      "I watched this because my wife wanted to see it and the synopsis on the back of the DVD case made it sound interesting. To be honest, if I hadn't read that synopsis I wouldn't have had a clue what the story was supposed to be about - even then I didn't think it was about self discovery as the synopsis claimed.<br /><br />I didn't find Tilda Swinton at all convincing as a man. Yes she looks vaguely androgynous but her voice gives her away as obviously female. There's also the small matter of her being almost the only male character in the Elizabethan scenes who isn't sporting a beard...<br /><br />I found the pace of the film to be dreadfully slow. There seemed to be endless long shots of people walking towards or away from the camera. I eventually reached the conclusion that these were to show off the wonderful cinematography (and some excellent Foley artist work) rather than to advance what there is in the way of plot. The first half of the film probably devotes more time to nothing much happening than it does to dialogue.<br /><br />Not a film that I'll be watching again.\n",
      "What would happen if we could live a series of past lives, strung together like pearls, with full cognition of them all? Orlando, written and directed by Sally Potter, explores this theme, but then also weaves another few strands along the way. The title character, played by Tilda Swinton, plays Orlando like a skittish school girl, who remains confused and emotionally isolated from herself, those dearest to her, and the world at large.<br /><br />While visually fascinating, Orlando bounds helter-skelter through 400 years of history and politics to make some fuzzy social commentary on gender, sexism, and love. The score is perhaps the most interesting element in a film that fails to connect with this viewer. It travels well through Orlando's four centuries, complimenting Swinton's movements with vibrations that haunt our senses. Like most art house period pieces, the sets are sumptuous creations, if a bit overblown with fabric and muted color.<br /><br />I kept asking myself was Swinton's restrained performance purposely done---or just purposeless? Well, with art house cinema, we'll be debating that for many centuries ourselves!\n",
      "Woolf's novel, Orlando is witty, clever, funny and has a remarkable evenness of tone and writing skill - certainly for her. It is a work of an artist in possession of their craft.<br /><br />This film version of that book has none of those qualities and while it is excellently designed and shot on a modest budget it lacks intelligence, wit and purpose: it is a pop music video. It is all surface and eye candy an Winton's performance incarnates that gloss. While she has a fine face, she is overtly wooden.<br /><br />But worse than that it has a smug and ever so cool media studies artiness as it breaks the frame to address the viewer. The film version is like a tier 3 university course called Feminist Poetics and Male Narratives...the mediocrity of its cinema realization is much to clear.\n",
      "Adapted from a novel by Virginia Woolf, this is a classic example of the triumph of style over substance. The plot concerning a young English aristocrat initially set in Elizabethan times charts how the character longs for love and companionship falls for a Russian girl who toys with his feelings and ultimately breaks his heart. Queen Elizabeth offers him a house and land if he can remain young and not wither away. Miraculously Orlando does not age at all and remains young (However the reason for this is not explained). He is given an then ambassador post in the East, forms a friendship with the ruler and gives them weapons to fight of a mutual enemy. He returns to England and falls into a long sleep and awakes as a female (yes really)and whilst out horse riding falls off her horse and amazingly along comes Billy Zane and the same thing happens to him they immediately feel something towards each other and return to Orlando's house and make love. He is a free spirit and ultimately returns to America. Then we quickly are rushed through the World Wars to the present day London where she has passed her writings to a publisher in the Docklands and we see her and her child riding off back to the House she owned for centuries. <br /><br />I have probably left a few things out. But then I felt there was a lot of emotional depth missing from this film. I did not for once find Tilda Swinton believable as a man in the beginning of the film. Even when Orlando changes sex I did not find her acting to be of the required emotional depth, although the script was probably partly to blame for this. I found some of the dialogue to be quite trite in places. And even though the story of Orlando could have been interesting this 90 minute film seemed like it was well over 2hrs. As another reviewer has stated, the character passes through these times but there is no real connection, you do not find out a great deal about the periods and what life was like as the film concentrates more on Orlando's emotional quest. Also I am not really a fan of movies where the protagonist often makes asides to the camera, in most cases it is not essential to the plot and adds nothing to the film.<br /><br />I would give this film 3.5 out of 10. It is not worth the time, unless you are a fan of Virginia Woolf's writing or interested in feminist movies, but even then there has been better. <br /><br />If you want to see a much better Tilda Swinton film I highly recommend you check out a 2001 movie called \"The Deep End\" she co-stars with Goran Visnjic.\n",
      "I am really at a loss in trying to review this movie... What is there to say about this film? Unfortunately, not much. Yes, Swinton gives a good performance, and yes the costumes are good, but that is just about all there is to this motion picture.<br /><br />Everything else is a mass of senseless mumbo-jumbo. This film has no story, no meaning, says nothing and is going nowhere. A complete waste of time and money, I really don't know what else to say about this film.<br /><br />But then again, it's probably one of those 'intellectual masterpieces' I am just too ignorant to understand. Silly me...\n",
      "This film deserves recognition by virtue of its cinematography and for the first class (almost brilliant) job done by the leading actress. The story was over worked and under researched. The suspension of disbelief must be supported in drama, not undermined as it was here. For a man to change sex, face a mirror for the benefit of the audience (look, breasts and no penis) and then declare that she felt no different but only looked different, is the biggest insult ever leveled at women in the history of storytelling. The differences between men and women (even the obvious ones) go far and above breasts and a penis. For many reasons, the story was too simplistic too obviously a slap in the face for pater and a nudge in the ribs for anyone who would giggle and snort or nod knowingly. What could have been a meaningful story about the dreadful abuse of women and the crazy notions forged by generation after generation of self interested, jealous and frightened men of power, turned out to be a soulless and simple romp, highlighted here and there with the help of \"painting by numbers.\"\n",
      "This film is a classic example of an arty film on a hallowed novel which gets brilliant reviews but is unapproachable and dull to the majority of the movie going public. Unless you have read the novel and are au fait with the subject matter, even the intelligent viewer will be left bemused and quite frankly bored to tears. Only for the die-hard Virginia Wolfe fans.\n",
      "Interesting film. Weird story, indeed, that makes you think a bit. But I found it quite unforgivable that you simply can't believe in the first part of the movie the main character is a man. Filmed already in these times of CGI and make up professionals, I can't understand why the filmmakers didn't make the actress look more like a man. Or, if this was too much a hard thing to do, why they didn't choose a real man to act in the first minutes. This is too obvious and too much disturbing not to rate the movie as high as it could have been. It leaves you with the feeling that the people who made this really didn't care enough about their work, or didn't think we deserved a clean job.\n",
      "Someone wrote in response to another confused, disappointed viewer: \"I'm hoping you are a brand new film student...if you cannot analyze this easily interpreted film, you are going to go crazy with Fellini, Truffant, and most other works of greatness. Wait till you see The Battleship Potemkin!! Don't give up though...art is an incindiary form of annoyance for many...open discussions are the secon best part of art.\"<br /><br />The writer was correct in stating that open discussions are the second best part of art. Great art arouses the soul and covers the spectrum of feelings, emotions, and the mind. However, for me, comparing this film with the great works of Fellini, Truffaut, and Eisenstein is annoying in itself. <br /><br />I saw this as a double-bill with \"Le Plaisir\" by Max Ophuls. For me, the distinction between art and an incendiary form of annoyance is clear - \"Le Plaisir\" is a realized masterpiece with brilliant source material. And then there is this, the annoyance!<br /><br />This film is not dreadful, but it is mediocrity teetering on the edge of the cliff. A very interesting proposition by Virgnia Woolf is just completely reduced to shallow banality. With so much worthy plumbing available with the source material's take on immortality, relationships, and androgyny, this (literally) skates on ice. This effort reminds me of Rand's \"The Fountainhead\" with Gary Cooper and Patricia Neal - full of shimmering possibilities and strikingly photographed, but poorly realized and interpreted. <br /><br />Tilda Swinton has the metamorphic wherewithal of Meryl Streep and Toni Collette required to pull off this role, but she doesn't ring true at all - there is none of the world-weary angst that this character, burdened by his/her past and fearful of the future, should embody. This character should oscillate between manhood and womanhood from a deep central core of wisdom, but I don't see this at all in Swinton's performance. <br /><br />Billy Zane's striking good looks don't translate well to the intriguing dovetail of Shelmerdine - his performance is weak, he photographs poorly, and there is no chemistry between the two characters. Quentin Crisp's take on Queen Elizabeth is the interesting moment in the film, but it is at best a campy one.<br /><br />This rates about a 3 for me. As such, I would love to see a remake of this up for the taking.\n",
      "Ever since I have seen Infernal Affairs (IA), I said to myself that Hollywood would not pass up on a story like this. And true enough, I heard Brad Pitt bought the rights to the show and that he and Tom Cruise are slated to act in it. When I heard that the whole ensemble changed, I still was looking forward to the film. IA, with a much smaller budget, looks more expensive than The Departed (TD).<br /><br />Character development -IA, is all about heart. It is about how the mole in the police, Ming, is torn between his identity as a mole, and his conscience, and the mole in the mafia/gangland, Yan, is torn between doing right for the police and his own dilemma about his identity. Ming is not bad, nor is Yan good. TD, like all other Hollywood cop movies, is about black and white. Costigan is wholesomely good, and Sullivan is utterly bad. Their characters are so one-dimensional, it's almost like the screenwriter doesn't trust his audience to be intelligent enough to know that good and evil are degrees of grey.<br /><br />Timeframe - The time frame is just ridiculous in TD. Are we expected to believe that in the short span of 4 months, Costigan is able to infiltrate the mafia and become Costello's left hand man, given that everyone (so 'cleverly' explained by Queenan) knows that he was a cop and that Costello doesn't trust people easily? Are we also to believe that Sullivan can rise through the ranks of the police force so fast, considering that (also 'cleverly' explained by Ellerby) they don't trust people with perfect records? In IA, it is a convincing many years. Both characters are allowed to grow into their environment enough to be torn. TD just throws it in our face.<br /><br />Acting - How can people say that the acting is superb? Matt Damon doesn't emote at all. Leo Dicarprio is so whiny, if he isn't whining to Queenan, he is whining to the shrink, or Costello and Mr. French. Martin Sheen is like a vase, so weak and wimpy, he doesn't have the air befitting of a Captain. Mark Wahlberg's character, sarcastic as hell, for what? It's a wonder that he is even there, he has no role to play at all. An omission of his character wouldn't have made the movie any less. The shrink sleeps with both Costigan and Sullivan, and we are expected to feel sorry for her? And Jack Nicholson, so painful to watch. Even the extras are so miscast-ed. The Mainland Chinese characters are so obviously 3rd generation Cantonese speakers, with the American accents, I am not a native Cantonese speaker and even I know it's all wrong.<br /><br />Screenplay - This has to be one of the worst screenplays ever.<br /><br />a. Costello, if he is a big time gangland boss, and that he is dealing with international crime lords, why is he and his right hand man still going round the hood to collect protection money? The writers cannot decide if he is a big-time crime lord or a smalltime mafia boss.<br /><br />b. the time-line.<br /><br />c. Costigan sends the tape to Madolyn, gets Sullivan to meet him at the building Queenan died, and expects to do what? It is just a cheap shot at trying to mirror IA's intelligent rooftop scene.<br /><br />d. The fact that the cast says F*** every other second makes the movie cheap and crude instead of realistic.<br /><br />e. the subplots are so unnecessary and so poorly intertwined. The double crossing of the mainland Chinese, the FBI informer subplot, the letter that was never heard of again, the love triangle between moles & shrink, the time in cadet school. All these subplots should be omitted, then maybe the director can concentrate on the real story.<br /><br />f. What's up with the ending? First Costigan is shot (Which is a ripped off from the original), and then everyone else gets shot in the head except Sullivan. Is there a need for all that gore? Or is it just cheap thrill? And then Dignam kills Sullivan. Does Dignam have a great enough agenda to do what he did? <br /><br />g. Did I mention that a lot of scenes of the movie are ripped off from the original? Even the dialog of some of the scenes is directly translated from the original. I read that the writer claims that he didn't see the original. Is he trying to claim the great parts of the movies as his own? Isn't that plagiarism? Which brings me to <br /><br />Production value - Scorsese bombed, big time. He has ran out of tricks, the movie started out good, but the ending seemed so rushed, like he has ran out of time, or interest. I love GoodFellas, and his style and techniques at that time seem fresh and ingenious. But the second time he used the pinhole effect in TD, I realize that Scorsese has ran out of ideas. There are even scenes that he took from the original shot by shot, making it seem like he cannot make his own out of the material.<br /><br />Over all I am very MAD. MAD at the people who say this movie is brilliant. It is brilliant only because the original is brilliant and they had taken almost every element of it. I am MAD because of the disregard of respect on the part of Scorsese's team, not giving the credits when credits are due. Is he going to get an academy award for something that is not his? Something that he so blatantly took from someone else and did not even bother to credit? That would say a lot about Hollywood and their disregard for anyone else. I am MAD at the way the movie ended and I am just disappointed that the audiences are treated like idiots and they don't know it.\n",
      "Well, due to all the hype I went to see this one with great expectations, although I must admit without having seen the parent film Infernal Affairs. What a let down ! Setting the scene is great, and time taken to achieve this is well spent, but for me the film started to drag, with expectation and patience well run out by the time the plot strands began coming together. Yes, Jack Nicholson is a great actor, but no he didn't convince me in the role, even though most of the good lines and deliveries were his. But Boston Irish ? Everyone, including the deliverer of the line \"I'm Irish & can live with something wrong the rest of my life....\" failed to convince me of Irish lineage. The accents, the faces, the attitudes were all wrong for souls in torment over doing what they believe they have to do, a basic for Irish/Catholic guilt and angst. <br /><br />The film would have been much stronger with unknowns in several key positions, and for me once the disparate strands were established the rest of the film was very predictable and I wasn't kept guessing - crucial if we are to suspend disbelief and have pressure and tension build in the viewer.<br /><br />DeCaprio fails to convince as a tough guy, despite the convincing scars. He stills comes across as an adolescent fuming after his pocket money's been withheld. Matt Damon looks like an awkward schoolboy, and was even less convincing than DeCaprio about being a cop. Mark Wahlberg sounded like he'd been taught to swear the week before, Martin Sheen was as hard bitten as a kitten and there were so many operational goofs the film became a comedy. A Federal agent running a State operation against his own informer? What a waste of time and budget monies. Only two people knowing about an undercover operation? BULL! Keep sending an undercover back after his nerve's gone ? Garbage ! Permanently deleting a full record (on a State Police computer no less!) without possibility of recovery ? Unbelievable - even children know data can be restored, and the system will keep a record of who deleted the information. For me, the film became a joke and I couldn't wait for the end to arrive so I could leave. By the time the end plays arrived and new players were falling like flies, the audience was laughing out loud at the inanity. Once again, Hollywood takes a good story and ruins it with poor crafting, no matter how well filmed. Very bad casting, a rushed and unfulfilling ending, far too much gore, not enough character substance, one dimensional players and an insult to the viewers intelligence.\n",
      "Caught The Departed last night and I have to say, its one abject failure of a remake. I was expecting it to be good, and truth be told, I wanted it to be good because it is based on Hongkong's Infernal Affairs, quite possibly one of the best gang flicks of all time. It is one of my personal favorites due to its brilliantly conceived plot of gang versus police, replete with paranoia and deceit. It is also quite possibly, one of the most intelligent films I have ever seen (second to Memento).<br /><br />Where do I even begin? There are just so many things to criticize about. Firstly, the utterly realistic characters in Infernal Affairs have been reduced to one dimensional vectors that merely carry the plot forward. Matt Damon's character was reduced to a bad ass villain and was almost gleefully ridding anyone who knew of his identity, with no hint of remorse even till the very end. In Infernal Affairs however, at the end of the film, Andy Lau truly wanted to be a good guy but obviously, circumstances did not allow him to, and therefore he was forced to kill the gang boss to protect his identity. He subsequently went crazy over the guilt of killing the police informant (Tony Leung, or Leornado in Departed). Infernal Affairs ended brilliantly because Andy Lau's character survived it all with no one knowing his true identity. He could therefore assume his role of a high-ranking police officer, but was ridden with guilt and constantly reminded of the people who died because of him. It was really tragic and you could almost sympathize with his character. And what's with the ending of The Departed?!! Do all Hollywood films have to have perfect fairy tale endings where the bad guy has to die? And even if he has to die, does it have to conclude with an abrupt scene that lasts 30secs, and not to mention, totally cheesy and lame. It seems like a quick way out to conclude the story. The climax at the lift in the abandoned building was also unintentionally funny as body counts skyrocketed as people just started dying ridiculously. The reaction that people had in that scene in Infernal Affairs was true shock",
      "'Oh my god!'. The reaction in Departed was quite the opposite  people started laughing.<br /><br />Also, the strange and awkward friendship between the police informant's boss and the gang boss was completely removed in the Departed. It was so enjoyable watching how the 2 former friends who are currently on opposite ends of the law, try to outplay each other in a full-fledged war of wits and power, but with grace as a result of their friendship in the past. This was COMPLETELY omitted in the Hollywood version. And also, there was a lack of tension between the police force and the gangs. Martin Sheen seems almost weak and hapless against Jack Nicholson and Nicholson himself appears barely sinister and intelligent. Another stupid omission was the friendship between the police informant and his boss, which was meticulously staged in Infernal Affairs, and culminated in a tragic climax when the boss fell off the building and landed right in front of the informant. This scene was attempted in Departed but failed miserably when Leornado tried to look sad when his boss died. There was no friendship to speak of between these 2 characters in Departed!!!<br /><br />The movie also tries way too hard to entertain. The crazy antics of Jack Nicholson is reminiscent of his character in Anger Management. Yes, Anger management, that rubbish of a comedy. And I do not understand why there are so much sexual references in the movie. There is sex, women and porno everywhere in the movie and is completely unnecessary and downright insulting. Gritty realism is not achieved by dumping sex scenes in the movie.<br /><br />I can go on and on and criticizing about almost every single aspect in the movie (like how unnecessary the role of the psychiatrist in the Departed was, but completely pivotal in Infernal Affairs etc.), and might as well write a thesis on this movie. To conclude, there was not a single scene of tension nor was it ever moving or exciting. In fact, i found it more funny than anything else. The acting was not particularly great as well despite a rather stellar cast. <br /><br />Infernal Affairs was an intricate and convoluted plot of deceit, lies, friendship, paranoia and love, at the hands of skillful directors who carefully stage memorable scenes and powerful climaxes  almost everything that Departed was not, despite an almost identical script. The critics are REALLY WRONG on this one. It is a complete failure of a remake, and even without comparison to the original Hongkong version, it is still a ridicule of an otherwise excellent plot. The editing was also fragmented and confusing, and coupled with horrendous pacing, the film gets progressively frustrating. Martin Scorsese has effectively removed everything that was so good about the original. Trust me, save your money and time, and watch Infernal Affairs, even if you have watched it already.\n",
      "Although I loathe a lot of what Hollywood does in films these days, I am willing to put up with much of it as long as the film pays off in the end. While there is much to admire in The Departed, the ending is one of the worst I have ever seen, below the standards even of Training Day and John Q. I was quite mesmerized up to the point where Costigan discovers the truth about Sullivan. In spite of Scorsese's compulsion/obsession with every filthy aspect of human nature, I was very much enjoying the performances and the story. Then, it seems he or the screenwriter had a brainfart. In light of that fact, all of the excess of the film caused it to implode. In the ensuing vacuum, I could find no redeeming quality of the film at all. What does the story tell us? It wasn't true to itself at all. No one gained a thing. No redemption. No resolution.<br /><br />I am not an expert on films in any way. But it seems to me that when a story is developed on the strength of a collection of main characters, the story had better wind up focusing on the relationship between them. One by one, the supporting cast is eliminated. Then one of the three main characters is killed off. That leaves the two lead roles, and as far as I'm concerned, at this point it has to come down to the two of them. Whether it's a showdown or a meltdown, this film had to close with Costigan and Sullivan forcing the outcome. Instead, they are both eliminated with as little drama as if they were innocent bystanders. The fact that these events left as many questions as answers tells me that the director really didn't know what he wanted the story to say.<br /><br />The acting was superb, the story captivating, the suspense almost unbearable - what more could you want from a good movie? Well, as far as I'm concerned, without a good ending, all of the above amounts to little more than the hype that usually precedes a film, but in this case makes up the bulk of the film. Enough with the blood and guts, Mr. Scorsese, enough with the profanity and vulgarity - lets see if you can make a film that succeeds on its own merits.<br /><br />And in the meanwhile, I would appreciate it if you could convince the studio to refund my money.\n",
      "When I heard Scorsese made this movie, i was very excited. Because one thing that i know, Departed will be an adaptation of my favorite Hongkong movie \"Infernal Affairs\" or \"Wu Jian Dao\". And when I read a magazine, the director denied and said it's only inspired by. So my expectation flew away. But all my dream has gone when I saw \"Departed\". It's all the same. Sorry, spoiler, how the boss gang died, how the captain died, how the undercover died, all the same. In short, all the important scene, are all the same. Maybe, they have different ending but if you have seen \"Wu Jian Dao\", \"The Departed\" just only follower. No need a big name like Scorsese just to remake an Asian movie. One thing, \"The Departed\" has lost the thrill that \"Wu Jian Dao\" have.\n",
      "The title clearly refers to Scorsese's talent, which vanished in a squirt of stage blood about 15 years back. He wasn't talented, he was brilliant -- but that was then. Today he should be making intelligent independent movies, elder statesmanly flourishes of wit and humanity, inspiring a younger generation. Instead, he's humiliating himself with overblown junk. His love affair with hoodlums is tiresome, his critique of Catholicism is ignorant and stupid -- I mean, I dislike Catholicism as an institution, and God knows it doesn't need me to defend it -- but any sociological or spiritual phenomenon with the history and complexity of Catholicism deserves better treatment than the head-kickings Scorsese metes out. And ironically, Scorsese has made his own Faustian pact with the Devil -- he had his years in the Hollywood wilderness and feels he won't get anything thoughtful financed -- so it's better to team up with a bankable but untalented actor and produce these lumbering, brainless sub-epics.<br /><br />Many people in their comments here have struggled to express quite how deeply bad this film is. I too am at a loss. It's intriguing for a while, then downhill races into one of the worst supposedly classy films EVER MADE. Jack does his Jack Show, because he is vain and because no one has the guts to tell him that it was already self-parody 20 years ago. Supposed hard man Leonardo looks as enraged as a poodle when the canine beautician has gone a bit to close to his ear with the electric clippers. Matt is actually OK in the light comedy bits, which makes one wonder why he has become Hollywood's current Brooding One. Wahlburg -- rubbish. Sheen looks like he's focusing all his energies on trying to deliver his lines without spitting out his dentures. By the way, I reckon the script originally developed the sexual thing a bit more -- as it implies that Damon is not as groovy between the sheets as Leo, and his homophobia and other things seem to hint at his being a gay in denial -- but they decided that audiences wouldn't buy a gay hero, or it scared Damon, or God knows what -- just another loose end in this spaghetti-plate of a movie.<br /><br />Overall, hardly anyone in this movie (Winstone is an exception) act-ually ACTS. They are all oh so boringly themselves. Consider Olivier in Marathon Man, how his characterisation of an ageing Nazi suggested all sorts of undercurrents of twisted psychotic nastiness -- and then look at Nicholson's leering, over-the-top gurning. Chortling as you pull the trigger on someone is not really quite enough to convince us we are witnessing evil, Jackie baby.<br /><br />By the way, the film shows cutting-edge developments in cinematic blood-squirting technology. Instead of the wounds exploding using charges that produce a small cloud of smoke, they sort of vaporize -- it looks like it's done with compressed air. A great advance Scorsese can be proud of. <br /><br />This film has been larded with praise -- by gaga members of the Hollywood money machine. Every year people say Scorsese deserves an Oscar, and it's usually because we remember his early films. Well, they have Lifetime Achievement Oscars if we want to reward a body of work. Now he has to go to his grave knowing he got the Oscar for a Turkey. Only he probably doesn't know. And do any of the egos involved in this mess care? Hollywood cynicism, parodied in Scorsese's last film, The Aviator! What a joke.<br /><br />Right -- my last word, if you're still reading. We are currently being told by our masters to hate Iran. It has one of the few cinemas in the world that sometimes try to show something true about the human condition. Whereas our civilization produces, as one of the top-billing cultural manifestations of the year, expensive to make, heaped with praise and awards, exported around the world and seen by multiple millions--something about as edifying as watching lions tortured or Christians having limbs lopped off at the Roman Colisseum two millennia ago. What does this say about us?\n",
      "Lets start with a very slow intro to an amazing story. Then lets compile a dream cast of characters to act out this amazing story. So amazing in fact that it very well could be the best movie of the year. Then once this character had given up everything and risked his life in nearly every scene, lets FINALLY give him the opportunity to hand over the dirty cop and set things straight. Well, we don't have time to finish the story with a great ending, so lets just kill him. Then at the end, lets kill the dirty cop so he can be decorated as a hero instead of turning over evidence so he can be convicted. This could have been the best movie of the year, and the story could have been told in well under 2 hours. They should have just opened and closed with a firing squad and I could have been in and out in 10 minutes with the same results.\n",
      "I'd have seen this film regardless of the reviews. Scorcese has directed some of the most significant, dramatic and best-told stories of our time, and with Nicholson, Damon, DeCaprio, Baldwin, Sheen, Walberg and the rest, it at least had a solid chance to be a tour de force. It's a mess, though, dragged down to lousy by a screenplay written by the same misguided pen of that disaster-bore-embarrassment \"Kingdom Of Heaven\". Bad or no structure can't be saved by over-cranking the ragefest volume.<br /><br />It's hard to say why Marty needs to wallow in even deeper pools of perpetual manic violence and blood at this point in his career. Maybe he still just likes it. Maybe he's feeling like we need to take some people out. Maybe the only way he could punctuate and hold together this cluster was with regular, loud, brain blasting, because if it weren't for the continuous bang-bang-blast, in-your-face-insults and face-punch scenes the story would've resembled a garbage pile. An interesting plot line was strung together by an amateur, though fortunately you've got watchable actors, some wry funny lines and a few outrage scenes that pop.<br /><br />The screenplay's choppy, the edits and lighting choices are weird, and the script's incongruent in a bad way. It never builds a tempo. That's Scorcese's fault. It was a great shame to see great actors content with accepting performance mania in lieu of characters. So in spite of all the odd-crazy, there're also huge bald spots. Nobody in this film goes beyond one-dimensionally anger-crazed, with the possible exception of DeCaprio. Still, I couldn't understand how Leo didn't explode during this film; he goes from appearing over-stressed and over-drugged to rage-psycho. I felt possessed to snort Ajax watching his crazed eyes and jaw grinding for 2 hours.<br /><br />I give it a '3' -- there's enough good violence to feel punched up after a numbing week at work.\n",
      "This movie has three things seriously wrong with it.<br /><br />1. The dialog is juvenile, evidently intended for kids in the 12 to 16 age group. It seems like every sentence included at least 3 curse words. Apparently the writers were handicapped when it came to vocabulary.<br /><br />2. The movie does not make use of Jack Nicholson's talents. He is upstaged throughout the movie by inferior actors.<br /><br />3. The movie has a very poor ending. Most of the characters get shot within the last few minutes, and then the screen says \"The End.\" Nothing was decided.\n",
      "Over-directed (pointless virtuosic touches that add nothing to what's happening on screen with the plot or characters), over-scored (save me from the freakin' metal Irish jig and the Stones, both heard twice in this thing), over-edited (the movie is awkward: scenes flow neither internally or into each other) and over-acted by Jack Nicholson (so far beyond the point of self-parody that it ceases to be funny), this horrid, horrid film is filled with two dimensional characters (except for Madolyn, the worst psychiatrist who never lived, who lacks even a second dimension) and more profanity and violence than you can shake a stick at.<br /><br />Really, I've never been a Scorsese fan, but this movie owes any praise it deserves for its twisty, turny plot to whatever was left over from the original \"Infernal Affairs\". Yes, in case you didn't know, this movie is a remake of a far superior Hong Kong film.<br /><br />As with \"Dreamgirls\", another inexplicably over-praised 2006 release, there's just no denying the nudity of this emperor. Tedious where it should be crackling and dull when it should be suspenseful, Marty and crew have made a nasty cinematic mess that really does not deserve the all-too-predictable praise that's been heaped on it. \"Instant classic\", \"best film of the year\", etc...<br /><br />I'm sorry, but the technical competency of the filmmakers is questionable and the emotional impact of the story is zip. By the last few minutes, as blowing a person's brains on the wall is becoming more of a cliché than you would ever think possible, I found myself hoping that some deus ex machina would descend from the sky and just kill everyone so it would just be f**king over already.\n",
      "I don't want to vote for this movie but I find it very low from the Americans to remake an Asian movie and to get (or will get)a bigger success then the original movie.I want to criticize the American movie industry because they are not original. It is better to search for original ideas then to play the role of the copycat in our society.<br /><br />I wanted to say my opinion to those who appreciate the American movie industry so much.(and surely this movie)<br /><br />good examples of remaked movies are : the ring , the grudge , the seven samurai, Godzilla , (masked rider) and more (they planned also to make an American version of Battle royale)<br /><br />Even if they remake it well they will never win my respect and i will consider it like fake.<br /><br />thank you\n",
      "I didn't know who directed the movie until the credits when the name Scorsese popped up, so I saw the movie without any expectations. I must say I wasn't very impressed. First off the infiltration of Costigan into Costello's gang happened way too fast and wasn't very convincing, just like the infiltration of Leo's character in Gangs of New York. Mark Wahlberg's character Dignam felt really fake, the kind of language he used was not very likely to be used by someone in his position, same goes for Baldwin's character capt. Ellerby. The love triangle drama was just pathetic, why would she date some ex con with drug problems when she's already moving in with Sullivan, a career cop who climbs the latter in the department like a sky rocket (i.e. very unlikely). They tried to portrait Costello as this big time mobster but the way he handled business felt more like a small time gangster, stealing pocket change from some corner shop.<br /><br />I haven't seen the original Infernal Affairs so I can't say weather or not this was worse, but I would really think so. The only part that surprised me positively was in the end when the other mull showed up and blew Costigans brains out, I didn't expect that one. That kind of woke me up, too bad it was just before the credits.\n",
      "Scorsese isn't what he used to be and as a Scorsese lover this pains me to say so. He must have sat down watched Goodfellas and thought 'hmmm. What did I used to do that made me great? I'll just copy that.' It's Scorsese imitating himself and not doing a very good job of it. The editing is quick and choppy like in Goodfellas but too much so the whole film is like one big montage with very little innovative direction. DeCaprio and Damon aren't great but neither are they bad, they just suffice. The actors that really shine are Mark Walberg, who finally ditches the breathless, confused moron he usually plays and does something way different and innovative with himself. Alec Baldwin is fantastic he has some of the best lines and is an actor who just seems to be getting better with age. Normally I'd say the same for Jack who's performance in 'As Good As It Gets', was groundbreaking but this time he's just playing The Joker in Batman he's too over the top for such a seriously acted movie. He was also made too nasty, just to make us dislike him with no seeming root for all his hostility. The original is far superior the only thing the remake does better is establishing DeCaprio in the gang before the fireworks start. Basically all the elements that make a Scorsese movie great weren't there; The violence was comic book (especially the number of head shots at the end), the film-making is sub-standard. Only the writing remained consistently good but even then it followed too closely the layout of Internal Affairs which is just plain lazy.\n",
      "This remake of \"Internal Affairs\", a great movie in its own right, adds a Whitey Bulger-John Connolly Boston twist that just BEGS for brilliance - it's a can't-miss story line with a powerhouse cast.<br /><br />However, it's a huge disappointment. Despite such compelling material, Scorsese only skims the surface, opting for gloss instead of substance, adding confusing sub-plots that serve mainly to hook the audience. These sub-plots destroy the momentum of the film and pull the whole thing off the tracks. Without these (no spoilers), the film may have had a chance. Scorsese's trademark violence stingers are now overripe at best. Am I the only one who started to yawn when people were getting pounded over a loud soundtrack in \"Casino\"? I doubt it...<br /><br />There is some pretty silly ensemble work here, too - we're not talking \"Glenngary Glen Ross\" or \"The Usual Suspects\" here by any stretch. Most of the bad highlights usually involve Wahlberg's profane fool of a character. Overall, the individual characterizations seem to be either shrill, as in the case of the annoying Wahlberg and chest-thumping Damon, or flat, like Sheen's police captain. Nicholson's Whitey Bulger take is completely lacking in menace - it's amusing, if nothing else. Only DiCaprio's brooding Billy Costigan stands out, but he's got nowhere to go, both literally and figuratively - the sub-plots basically turn his character to face the wall... <br /><br />Much has been made of the ending here, but I would describe it with one word - \"cowardly\". I just couldn't respect this film much, particularly in light of \"GoodFellas\" and other Scorsese masterpieces. Overall, 4 stars and only because it's him - probably the worst best picture Oscar since \"American Beauty\".\n",
      "I am a fan of Martin Scorsese but this movie sucks. This movie is a remake of a Hong Kong movie called \"Internal Affairs.\" If you have never seen the original, then please do so because you will definitely appreciate how well the original was as opposed to this crap made by Scorsese.<br /><br />Why do I hate \"Departed?\" First, Scorsese was an idiot putting Jack Nicholson as the crime boss because he is going to steal the whole damn movie. Nicholson is that talented. Plus, Scorsese gave too much part to the crime boss character. He should have been a tangential character with the real crux of the movie focused on Matt Damon and Di Caprio.<br /><br />Second, Matt Damon's character was too one dimensional or there was no real complexity to his character. He was simply bad. In Internal Affairs, the bad cop was more complex. In that movie, you see a cop becoming annoyed by the crime boss who he sees as a threat to his future.<br /><br />Third, there was more violence and sex in this movie than in Internal Affairs and I love gratuitous violence and sex in a movie so long as it is done properly. Scorsese just injected more sex and violence to cover up his terrible script adaption of an excellent film.<br /><br />Fourth, the dialog was fine but again, it lacks intelligent discourse among the principal characters so I cannot say it was great writing. It was simply mediocre at best.<br /><br />Fifth, and primary reason I hate this movie is that there is no real TENSION between the characters. Oh sure, Damon character wants to kill Di Caprio and vice a versa but there has to more to this than that. In the original, there was interaction between the bad cop and good cop, but you see that the bad cop is not so truly bad and therefore, the audience is torn. What I am trying to say is that there was a subtle buildup to the real tension in that movie which makes you really appreciative of the quality of that movie as oppose to this crap.<br /><br />That being said, if you have never seen Internal Affairs, then you will like this movie. But if you are like myself and some others who have seen it and have seen this movie as well, then you will be disappointed. In fact, for those who decide to rent Internal Affairs, I can almost guarantee that you will like Internal Affairs much more than Departed. You will like Internal Affairs so much more that you will see what a junk Departed really is.\n",
      "While eventually the meek are supposed to inherit the earth, first they stop in Japan to inherit two million yen off the Yakuza and Baby Yakuza as portrayed here by the Keystone Kops.<br /><br />But while our two little wallflower protagonists find a whopping $2MY, the real score is in finding each other. And guess what...pretty soon, they'll be Mr and Mrs Meek.<br /><br />Yuck...<br /><br />The characters in this film lack both adrenaline and drive... The casting director I think was too good for the film's own good, and our humdrum hero and heroine just never seem to get the action, nor the romance, in gear.<br /><br />Granted the mousey librarian of a nurse does get a fashion makeover; who would have ever thought she was so beautiful? Eventually besides a couple of nice outfits, she adopts a bit of matching verve (swoon as she takes off her glasses and almost kisses a boy, savor as she kicks off her heels and chases down a bus).<br /><br />Yawn...<br /><br />The acquaintances to the crime are just too quaint, I feel I was the victim here.<br /><br />3/10\n",
      "I'll give a \"last letter\" here ... \"D-,\" a grade that misses \"F\" only because I HAVE seen worse. Rarely.<br /><br />Bad script, bad acting, bad everything. \"Twelve Angry Men,\" this is not. Yet, the writer/director somehow thought he'd weave a tale that takes place around a juror's table and VO sepia flashbacks involving the case. Not a respected device for exposition, and this film illustrates why. Not only do twists seem like cheats (i.e. the audience had no shot of discovering it,) but they're just unbelievable to start with.<br /><br />Stiff, wooden lines do nothing to further the careers of unknowns and past-prime actors here. The ending, unsatisfying and vapid, shows the writer's belief that we'll buy into anything.\n",
      "This is a terrible, terrible movie. I like bad movies, but I couldn't even sit through this piece of trash. All of the actors (or should I say 'over-actors'?) were terrible caricatures of characters in Twelve Angry Men, the plot is trite (they probably stole a good part of it from CSI or something), and the flashbacks of the murders are terribly shot and filtered with something yellow so they are also physically hard to watch. Unless you have watched every other movie ever made, for Pete's sake don't get this one. If you're looking for jury drama, go with the original version of Twelve Angry Men instead. And if you're looking for an actual psychological thriller, there are hundreds better than this one.\n",

      "Man, what a movie. Pow! Zip! It's like an 18-act Italian opera taking place in the center ring of a three-ring circus while bears waltz and elephants stand on their heads on either side.<br /><br />Every camera trick known to man or beast is put to use. If Anna Batista (Argento), the famous actress, does a line of Special K, it's only to give the camera a chance to show us more phantasmagorical horrors in lurid color. The sink into which she tries to puke turns to rubber and so forth. And there's her mother's ghost.<br /><br />And it never stops. Well, not exactly. There are occasional pauses in the tumult while Anna and her friends seem to functioning normally, but the pauses are only there as lead-ins to the next bout of victimization.<br /><br />I lost count of the number of times Anna is roughly assaulted by men. The most memorable (because the funniest) is \"the finest writer-director in the world\" who summons her to Amsterdam. She's expecting to go over her script for Cleopatra but when she opens the door to his shabby multicolored garbage-strewn room she finds him lurching about, his pants unzipped, jerking in spasms, and managing to moan: \"I've been an alcoholic for four years -- and now I'm on SMACK.\" The poor girl turns her head away in disgust while he shoots up. Then as he flops beside her on the couch and points out his new knife scar, she suggests they talk about the script. But the world's greatest writer-director has other things on his mind. He throws himself all over her, blubbering and pulling at her black slacks, while she squeals and manages to push him away. He calls her a woman of low repute, slaps her several times, and she rushes out the door.<br /><br />It must be some kind of female fantasy, or maybe it's just Asia Argento's thing, but the whole movie darts from one attempted rape to another. One is committed by some babe with surgically enhanced bosoms the size of basketballs. Another rape -- another rough one -- is attempted by some Hollywood producer of schlock films. He wears a curious beard but no underwear, and he sounds precisely like Dennis Miller.<br /><br />She has only one true love, an Australian rock singer of no distinctive talent. They meet and immediately go to bed. She winces when he crawls atop her and tells Keith that she's never made love before. \"Are you a virgin?\" \"No, I'm a whore.\" That one-night stand with a man who turns out to have a wife and children was a dangerous one inasmuch as it impregnates her. On this discovery she runs big-bellied through the night-time streets of Rome until she collapses before a painting of the Virgin and Child. Her lost love appears in the distance, silhouetted by a halo of bright light -- so bright that she must blink when looking into it. It's left unclear whether she'll give birth to the next Messiah or the second Buddha. End of movie.<br /><br />It's a silly, low-budget piece of trash, and yet it doesn't diminish any respect I might have had for Asia Argento, the writer, director, and star. The writer and the director have thoroughly deglamorized the star. The DVD opens with Argento, sans makeup, looking wanly into the camera and telling us, \"I know you might have heard some bad things about this movie. But don't be afraid. After you watch it, maybe you will get to know me a little better -- and I will get to know you.\" We get to know the character pretty well. For several minutes we watch her tattooed naked body before a bathroom mirror while she shaves her armpits, applies lipstick, and watches tears roll down her cheeks.<br /><br />The rape scenes are not at all erotic and Argento places the camera so that her body seems less like an object of desire than a dressed cabrito hanging in a butcher shop window. I mean, there is a brief shot of her bare ass as the slime ball Hollywood producer tries to pull her dress up and it the thought this undignified camera angle prompts is not how pretty her rear end is but how vulnerable the character, Anna Batista, is.<br /><br />The movie may or may not be very autobiographical, but in either case it's not a facile quest for pity from the audience. This bipolar dynamo can take care of herself. She lashes out hoarse, filthy curses at her tormentors in three different languages, a volcano of pejoration.<br /><br />I wish that energy and that disgust for artificiality had somehow been used as the engine for a better story. Or for any story at all. As it is, I think Argento was right when she said we might get to know her better. We wind up with more respect for her courage and sincerity.\n",
      "Asia Argento had an introduction to this movie, saying that she hopes people will understand her better or worse. One would hope that there is more to Argento than this movie shows. Her character is flat and, to be honest, really dumb. Anna meets a rock star and after knowing him for, maybe, a few hours, sleeps with him and tells him they made love. Then, she seems surprised when he tries to sneak out in the morning. Basically, that is it. An old man tapping a documentary tries to molest her, a film director tries to rape her, and some random blonde girl gets off on top of her. Then, shock of shocks, the rock star has a wife and doesn't love her. The most honest part of the movie was the introduction, where you can see the longing in her eyes as she asks you to enjoy her movie. It's the only interesting thing in this mess.\n",

But again, Getting acclaims from small Film Festivals are the easiest thing nowadays. Even the small Film Festival organizers very well know that you need a Distribution.

      "This is a film that fails dismally by itself, but is redeemed by a truly great DVD special feature.<br /><br />I truly love experimental movies and imports and this clearly falls into that category. But, the film is not at all well done. It's dull in many places and too often reduces to sex for the sake of prurient interested. The plot, or lack of plot, rambles about and is very confusing. Some of the symbolism is so obscure you won't know it until you listen to the director's commentary. You have trouble identifying with any of the characters because they are so unrealistic.<br /><br />But, it is in the area of the DVD director's commentary that this film shines brightly. Just out of curiosity, I turned it on after watching the film and was surprised how much I learned about the film, the directing process, the actors, and the director's life. Interestingly enough, the commentary is far better than the actual film. Though the film is meant to be somewhat autobiographical, the real facts of Asia's life are far more interesting and make much more sense, though they be somewhat strange to those of us looking from the outside. So many commentaries tend to be just some trivia about the shoot. This one tells lots of great stories about the people and process. You'll learn so much about stolen shots and when the sex is real and when it's not. I wish more commentaries went out on a limb to tell of truth about what is going on in the creative process as she has done here.\n",
      "Self indulgent and occasionally sexy... and those are the good points. Asia Argento is trying to make La Dolce Vita and winds up making Syd and Nancy from Nancy's point of view... if Nancy were Scary Spice. Okay... okay... that's unfair. But not by much. Flashes of a good movie are few and far between, but they're there. Not recommended except for fans.\n",
      "<< some may consider a few things below spoilers, but i do not. they have no impact on the storyline and give nothing away >><br /><br />this film was the worst i have seen in quite some time. the first 3/4 of the film have nothing at all to do with the storyline and just consist of drawn out character development for characters i care less than nothing about. the last 1/4 had what looked like the start of a promising thriller in it, but then it all just fell apart. I'm trying hard not to give anything away for those who do wish to see it, but the ending makes no sense in several different ways and there is a very high level of politicking going on here.<br /><br />its hard to tell whether those who made the film wanted to snipe at the middle east or the Americans, because both will be insulted after seeing this film. our 'terrorist' has rather serious mental health problems, which seems to suggest that he has no rational justification for the acts he planned to carry out. near the end we are given his reasoning but the fact that a Libyan (the only non American in sight) is mentally disturbed and a terrorist is deeply insulting. as for the Americans, well the film opens with the thickest piece of hypocrisy I've ever seen, george bush making a speech. even those who are bush supporters would have to admit that this speech and the propaganda that is spouted by laurens character during the film is at least as true (if not more true) if you replace words like 'terrorist' and 'muslim' with 'soldier' and 'american' or 'christian'.<br /><br />i fail to see what point, if any, this film was trying to get across to the viewer. its overuse of tertiary characters, the inexplicable decisions made by them, the lack of any drive in the narrative (if you can call it that), and that mentioned above makes this a truly shameful waste of time and money for all those involved and any who choose to see it. i rate this film 0/10, which is rare, because i see no redeeming features in it whatsoever. some, however, may enjoy the sex scenes so for those only wanting to see that, i give it 3/10.\n",
      "There's an adage in the world of drama, which goes something like this -- \"a pistol hung on the wall in Act One must be fired by Act Three\". I think it was Chekov who said that but I could be wrong.<br /><br />There's almost nothing to like about this confused mess of a movie, except for the strong presence of Lauren Holly as the U.S. Senator and Angus MacFayden as her sinister brother. It seems to be totally unlikely that such a clever political operator as 'the Senator,' who is a controlling and driven person, would be unable to rein in her do-wrong brother. He's a bottom feeder, a leg-breaker for some loan shark who has absolutely no scruples.<br /><br />The goofy drug-addled daughter -- Cassie -- gets to make a very fine presentation of a Martin Luther King speech, but only after she's already dead in the plot.<br /><br />This movie is a mess, with conflicts presented that have no discernible origins and actions taken by the principal characters which have no discernible back-grounding. It reeks of spy movie clichés without giving the viewer any kind of orientation ....<br /><br />Yes, the actors do very well with a minimalist script and some nice photography, and the viewer wants to know more about them before the tragic ending turns into 'bathos,' i.e., imitation pathos.<br /><br />It cannot be recommended for any of those reasons. It is as if the producer/director lost some pages of a much bigger and better script and then ran out of film, money and maybe even time to finish the story. It's not a boring film, it's a confusing and unsettling and emotionally unavailable film, even though the entire presentation of the plot is based on the emotions of the leading characters.<br /><br />There's lust, there's love turned to hate, there's dissolute drug-induced behavior and two totally a-moral bad guys, one of whom is the brother character. What an absolute and total waste of a potentially great theme, great cinematography, and intensely personal acting.<br /><br />The DVD is well done. Too bad that the excellent transfer was used to put this absolutely worthless film on digital media. I cannot even recommend it for being so entirely bad, as it isn't, for the reasons I've noted. This film starts well and then descends into a swamp of nihilism and sour, unrepentant, dramatic manipulation.<br /><br />Too bad IMDb doesn't provide negative numbers for ratings, because this howling dog deserves a minus 10 .....\n",
      "OK...I think I missed something here. Not to mention I did like the ending on this at all. I watched this a least three time already and is still lost. Was Roger supposed to be some kind of under cover terrorist driving around in that cab? OMG...did I misinterpret this film or what. I keep watching and watching and I'm still lost. The ending could have been better. I'm still looking for more. However i did read the synopsis on this and it was nothing like I thought it would be. Overall there may have been some good shots here but I was very disappointed. And if I had wasted my money to go see this in the movies, I'd asked for a refund...No,no,no better yet... I would've demanded a refund. You disappointed me in this one Guenveur.<br /><br />Grumble\n",
      "I have no doubt the guys who made this film had some semblance of creating a complex character study of the post 9/11 political world, but somebody prodded them that drug use by teen hotties and sado-masochistic sex thrown in for good measure might help things along. Everyone in this film is fairly loathsome, with the Muslim extremist possibly coming off as the most sympathetic of the ensemble until the end. There is nothing special about the performances, mostly by b-movie actors. Lauren Holly as a hard line Republican US Senator maybe the most ridiculous bit of casting since Denise Richards was made a nuclear scientist in \"The World Is Not Enough\".\n",
      "Bad film-noir, if you could call it that. Its as if the stars involved were sedated through the whole film, and lets not talk about the plot.The worst performance Edward G.Robinson ever gave in a film, with his emoting over his partners death with as much passion as if a waitress served his coffee black instead of with cream. And his bad decisions were responsible for his death to boot. And Geroge Raft-first he's sort of a good guy gangster, then he turns completely cold-blooded brushing off the death of a completely innocent 21year old woman by his partner, then he turns to be a good-guy again because the writers could'nt think of anything else. I LOVE old black and white movies, but don't waster your time with this stinker.\n",
      "Despite its fascinating writing and editing credits, this movie emerges as a surprisingly dull little \"B\"-grader, not only paced with the speed of a snail but full of more empty talk than a bag-pipe. The characters could not even justly be described as one-dimensional. They are mere shadows that unconvincingly act out the hollow and threadbare plot. Certainly pros like Robinson and Van Eyck do manage to breath a bit of life into their portrayals, but insufficiently virile to overcome the inertia of Mr Allen's studiously slow, uninvolving handling.<br /><br />It's hard to believe tutor and text book author, Leon Barsha, had anything to do with the editing. The insertion of stock travelogue footage is clumsy in the extreme. Other credits are likewise patently routine.<br /><br />Considerable pruning would definitely help the film, although Miss Totter is likely to remain a firm liability. Mr Letondal would also stay far more colorless than the screenplay demands. Last but not least, the unconvincingly patriotic climax is something not easily overcome.\n",
      "If there's ever an award for \"Most Boring Film Noir Ever Made,\" this little stinker would be in strong contention. It is a miserable, plodding police procedural with essentially nothing to recommend it. About the best you can say is that the last 15 minutes are marginally less dull than the rest. Edward G. Robinson is squandered. Set in Montreal, the film has all the French-Canadian flavor of Frank Sinatra singing \"O Canada.\"<br /><br />IMDb thinks the above review is too short. Boy, they sure wouldn't think so if they'd had to sit through this turkey. I have already given it far more words than it deserves.\n",
      "Spriggan is one of the worst types of anime movies one can watch. The characters are undeveloped, the plot is ridiculous and the plausibility impossible.<br /><br />The main character, Yu, for example, recovers multiple times after being a hair breadths away from death. Likewise, his partner Jean survives every major catastrophe from being run over by a giant snowmobile, falling off a cliff, being torn to shreds by dinosaurs and even being shot by accident by Yu.<br /><br />The plot of Noah's ark as a climate control and human creating device has absolutely no relevance to the movie. That ark's purpose is to merely serve as an object in which two competing forces - the Pentagon and AROAM, the unit Yu serves - are fighting for.<br /><br />Many times the duologue goes into ridiculous, incomprehensible speech such as third dimensions, and whatnot.<br /><br />Other random crap: 1) Only one woman in the entire movie - Maragaret, who plays no significant role - only serves to pull a professor from death by the antagonist, a wire wielding genetically modified toddler 2) Random enemies who were once Yu's partners but whom he seems to enjoy killing mercilessly 3) Jumping from scene to scene with no smooth transition or logical connection at all, such as traveling from Istanbul to Mt. Arrarat In Conclusion: This warped, disconnected plot and unaffable characters make this movie a sure miss. Don't watch it. You'll pity yourself afterwards.\n",
      "Shame on me. Shame on me for mindlessly buying this movie based on internet recommendations. I went to an anime site that allows you to enter a movie you like, and you will receive recommendations. The movie I entered is Akira. This was the number one recommendation. I cannot begin to conceive how and why this movie came up. Akira is EXCELLENT, in every facet of it's execution--plot, characters, animation, etc... This is sh*t.<br /><br />To begin to review this pile of garbage is to grant it too much consideration, but I will allow some of that. I think the problem starts with the fact that the object of mystery is Noah's Ark. This of course means hearing scripture. (Remember, I'm embarrassed even to be writing this, because I just bought the movie.) The scripture is quoted *just enough to be vaguely unsettling in the fact that it is Christian. I don't mean to belabor this point though, as you'll probably hear less than 20 seconds of the stuff; but in a movie in which the combined dialogue runs for 5-10 minutes, it's something to think about. The whole plot is right out of Indiana Jones, minus the good movie part.<br /><br />Really it's just a mindless shoot-em-up with a VERY thin plot, and completely disposable characters. Two of the characters are called Fatman and Little Boy (just brilliant). This should appeal to boys ages 8-10. The dialogue, sparse as it is, is totally laughable: \"We can't all be Schwarzenegger.\" or French Spriggan: \"I don't bluff, mon ami.\" I wish I was a member of the site that recommended this movie, so I could try to attempt to understand how this movie came into comparison with Akira. I would personally rate Akira about a 9. I'm giving this a 2. I was going to give it a 3, because of the animation, but the style of the animation is totally generic; in point of fact there IS no style.<br /><br />TEN THUMBS DOWN. I was on the verge of crushing the DVD when I considered that there might be some resale value--to some eager young child, or mindless schlub such as myself.\n",
      "Spriggan should stand out as one of the single most stupid and garbage packed films in anime history. This film is nothing more than a \"Rambo-The Teenage Years\" mock up. The main characters is totally uninteresting and is relatively indestructible, so there's no reason to have any anticipation what-so-ever.<br /><br />The story is rather stupid as well, centering around the discovery of Noah's Ark. Apart from that the movie involves many explosions, graphic deaths, and more explosions.<br /><br />What adds insult to injury is the animation. While rather good and relatively fluid, it shows that more money went into making a lousy movie look good than actually starting out with a decent movie in the first place. Polish a turd and it's still a turd. Also, if you're looking for something along the lines of Akira animation, look elsewhere as this movie has none of the style, daring use of lighting and color, or technique that Akira pioneered.<br /><br />Another rather bothersome element is the terrible voice acting done by the child in the movie. While original voice actors are always superior to a dubbed voice, I don't see how a dubbed voice could sound more \"mechanical\" or \"forced\" than that child did.<br /><br />This movie appeals to the lowest common factor in people. It offers nothing more than explosions, an idiotic plot, and utterly unlikeable characters. Avoid at all costs.\n",
      "I watched Spriggan at the local Film Festival back in April '99 and I really think it's a piece of unashamed, over-commercialised, fan-boy rubbish.<br /><br />There were just too many parallels to Akira, from the art direction to the use of a prematurely-aged, grey-haired boy with blow-your-brains-out pyscho-mental powers,... except, this time the kid is American.<br /><br />Then there is the \"hero\" who seems indestructible, is filled with angst because of his traumatic past at the hands of his grotesgue former commander (who is now of course his prime enemy). Said \"hero\" has kungfu moves so flashy he puts Street Fighter to shame. And when he REALLY gets in trouble - no problemo, he's got an even more-indestructible side-kick who always appears in the nick of time. (Even after he's left for dead in an earlier battle.)<br /><br />Then the all-explosive \"climax\" as the doomsday Ark is blown away (was there ever any doubt?). Oh yeah, the fist pumping and high-fives being passed around by the surviving grunts really sent a shiver down my spine. Hard to believe Otomo allowed his name to be associated with this piece of junk.<br /><br />Avoid, avoid, avoid!\n",
      "this is just plain bad!!!!!!!!!!not funny at all!!!are they going to take this off the air i hope! good god!!!!!i notice it has the talentless limited no range guy or girl (because hes kinda like pat from Saturday nite live) that made that stupid you tube video shoes!!this guy needs to just come out of the closet!!! he is suppose to be straight in this show god he couldn't be more of a fem!!!!and the rest of them are just not funny!!!!really bad concept as well, caught this once and that was enough for me!!im guessing that some of these comments are from the people associated with the show itself ,cause i watched it with a few people and we felt embarrassed for those involved in this. sorry to be so harsh here,but VH1 has gone down the tubes,pick better shows guys!!\n",
      "The concept behind this show is good, but the crappy writing, actors and sorry excuses for jokes threw it all away.<br /><br />I just don't understand how things like this even make it on the air. Why are wonderful shows like \"Freaks and Geeks\" and \"Arrested Development\" even considered for cancellation? The acting is bad. Just plain bad. The \"jokes\" are a slap on the face for its viewers. The only reason I tuned in was for Liam Sullivan, whom I assumed would have more common sense than signing up for this. I hope he finds better work, because this show can not go pass its fourth episode.<br /><br />And our protagonist, is just HORRIBLE.\n",
      "Some films have it all. This doesn't. It opens quite ok, a bunch of friends gathered for a wedding. But very soon the movie hits the unthinkable level. I like strange movies, but they have to be somewhat logical, to the characters at least, but there are too many unthinkable, unbelievable actions taken in this movie:<br /><br />** SPOILERS BELOW ** READ IT, DON'T SEE THE FILM<br /><br />1) The robber \"Hamlet\" has to rob the bank on his friends wedding day. Stupid, unnecessary, risky<br /><br />2) When Buzz comes storming in, he removes his hood, and the two guys uses their real names. Stupid.<br /><br />3) The other guys drop by, no other person attempts to enter the bank, only these guys, although the bank is full of people. Unlikely.<br /><br />4) The helicopter pilot all of a sudden gets his hands on a Lynx? My god, he is a lunatic who got fired from the army, no chance in hell is he gonna get his hands on an army helicopter!<br /><br />This movie sucks, and I regret staying up to see it.<br /><br />\n",
      "The best way I can sum it up is a cross between a David Mamet movie and Starship Troopers. Here is why... There are two kinds of people. The people who understood STARTSHIP TROOPERS, and those who didn't. These are people who looked at the superficial exterior and then stopped there, failing to see the true brilliance of the satire and the other fascinating qualities it had to offer. These are the kind of people who look at the sand on the beach, and see only dry sand. They then assume that all the sand is dry, even though it is wet just below the surface.<br /><br />Best men is like Mamet in that the dialogue is not the way real people talk, but is stylized, much like Shakespeare stylized his. The way shakespeare wrote was far from the way people talked back then. BEST MEN actually has close ties to shakespeare, as his work plays a major part in the plot. The film is in a way a tribute to shakespeare and his work. The script is in my opinion one of the best and most layered scripts I have ever seen or heared. Unfortunately I don't know if most people will realize how good it really is. The acting is acceptable for the most part. The only really great performances are turned in by Dean Kane, and Brad Dourif (who is one of my very favorite character actors.<br /><br />If you are going to see this movie, I would recommend seeing it with a completely open mind, have no pre-notions of what it will be, because you won't get what you are expecting. I didn't, I expected a Drew Barrymore movie, but she actually has a rather small role, but I good one.\n",
      "Imagine, you have 90 minutes to fill by means of a movie. This movie is supposed to be a thriller, black-humoured, exciting and deep in character. You have five main characters and a couple of supporting characters and now, please press all of them into these 90 minutes and include a background story about each of them. The result is a movie like Best Men with a challenging idea standing at the beginning and apart from that, over-loaded with characterizations created along one of those books on 'How to Write a Damn Good Screenplay'. The dialogues lack ideas because there is no time to develop them, so they have to be reduced to standard phrases. If stretched, however, they would be boring. Another result is that the characters all have exciting and heart-rending pasts but regarding their present situations they remain flat. Maybe they had better not tried to realize that attractive idea.\n",
      "What a train wreck.<br /><br />Watching the opening credits the audience is granted some manner of false hope; Wilson, Cain, Flanery, Dick, Ward, and Barrymore...not to mention direction from the talented Tamra Davis. Add in music by Mark Mothersbaugh and you might think you were in for a really entertaining hour and a half. You'd be wrong.<br /><br />Instead this is 90 minutes of your life you'll be wishing you had back. This movie fails miserably in spite of its passable cast. The script is miserable tripe, with each member of this derelict wedding party recounting their own unique story, one more cliché than the next.<br /><br />The supporting cast features a bevy of film stereotypes; the distant father, the crazy veteran, the villainous FBI agent...even a black security guard named after a ball player! How embarrassing.<br /><br />Beyond the bad script, sub par performances, weak story, and average direction, Best Men never really decides where it wants to go. Comedy, dark comedy, action-adventure, drama; as it flounders it never achieves any of these goals.<br /><br />Don't be fooled by the stars, this is grade A loser not worthy of its cast or its director.\n",
      "There are some movies so bad,that when you watch them on video or TV,you wonder, \"Why did they bother with this?\" \"Why didn't they shelve it?\" That's what I wondered when I caught this unoriginal,cliché' filled movie on late night TV.<br /><br />The first hour of this movie (including commercials) is truly a mess and completely unbelievable. While I can see the possibility of a man getting out of jail and going to his waiting bride, I could not buy how he and his friends end up helping their buddy \"Hamlet\" (Billy)in the bank and keeping their fellow towns-people hostage. Even more ridiculous is that because the guys are \"nice\",they end up basically helping them too.<br /><br />Dean Cain is really the only convincing male actor of the five (at least in the first 1/2). Although his coming out of the bank,with guns blazing is just plain stupid,along with the fact that he's wearing guns under his tuxedo in the first place.<br /><br />Andy Dick seems to only be able to play one character his whole career,a strange,nerdy kind of Matthew from \"News Radio\" boy-man. He really has no place here and his \"tell off the wife over the phone\" scene has been done way too many times in movies and TV shows,it's completely unoriginal.<br /><br />As is most of this blatant small town rip-off of \"Dog Day Afternoon\" (which they at least acknowledge their ripping off). We get a sheriff who's the father of wanted criminal \"Hamlet\". We also get the cliché' of the crowd cheering for \"Hamlet\" like he's some kind of Robin Hood folk hero! \"I went to high school with that guy!\" Says one of them,then they're chanting \"Hamlet\" over & over.<br /><br />So,we get the \"you we're never there for me dad\" plot,which has also been done in movies TV shows. Which made it hard to be sympathetic,but not just in that case,I couldn't sympathize with any of these characters. Even after finding out about their personal downfalls.<br /><br />The Vietnam vet is so much a cartoon that what could have been a great character is wasted. As are the acting talents of Drew Barrymore. Her presence in all this is spread quite thin. <br /><br />Then there's the expected FBI converging on the town,with the leader who just wants to blast the bad guys away. He and the sheriff are of course at at odds with each other and the other big city FBI men make fun of the small town's people. \"They should be used to shot gun weddings here.\" (Referring to Barrymore and her boyfriend wanting to get married in the middle of a hostage situation.) <br /><br />I really only got into the movie when the more truthful and real elements came into play. When Andy is the first to get shot and then the FBI shooting up Cain and \"Hamlet's\" get away bus in a scene somewhat similar to the ending of Clint Eastwood's,\"The Gauntlet\". \"Hamlet\" and father make amends just before that and Dad let's his son get away. (Oh please!) <br /><br />Then the final two biggest rip off's of all. Barrymore and soon to be husband are given the stolen money by \"Hamlet\" and they fly of in the Vietnam Vet's helicopter and escape scott free. Shades of \"D.B. Cooper\"! <br /><br />Dean Cain and \"Hamelt\" then have one bullet each in their guns after the bus crashes and their all shot up. Just like the final scene in \"Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid\" they come running out together and Cain takes down the leader of the FBI,who he swore he'd take out. <br /><br />All the supposed \"reasons\" these characters have for letting themselves into this mess are contrived and flimsy at best. I would say if this movie had been made a long time ago and had there not been \"Dog Day Afternoon\",it might seem more plausible but even the intense last half,which did hold my interest,is not enough to like this movie.<br /><br />Four stars for the final,intense attempted getaway chase scene and \"Hamlet's\" very well spoken Shakespearian quotes,which do fit in here and the movie thankfully taking a needed turn into reality. Otheriwse,I'd never bother with \"Best Men\" again. (END)\n",
      "A good set of dialogue and a nice bunch of actors do nothing with this terrible story. Best Men never develops any of its characters deeply enough for the audience to care about them in any way. We hear briefly about each man's troubled life and how he in one way or another has been treated unfairly or has screwed up his own life. Yet, all of it is so poorly constructed and recklessly thrown together that you never get a sense of why these characters are redeemable. Now I don't necessarily need redeeming characters in movies, but this is what the film was obviously trying to portray. Further still, the film ends with a cute and a tidy ending. A completely unsatisfying film.\n",
      "\"Best Men\" can't seem to make up its mind if it wants to be a comedy or a drama and scrambles both while compromising each only to cap the confusion with some mediocre action. A technically okay production with a decent cast of 2nd tier talent, this film is a directorial disaster with a sloppy make-it-up-as-we-go-along storyline. Character development is not sufficient to allow the audience to summon the emotions the film seems to demand and comedic purpose is lost in quotes from Hamlet and a lot of sappy personal relationship issues.\n",
      "What a pathetic embarrassment this is to Fred Ward, Andy Dick, Dean Cain, and Sean Patrick Flahery. The situations were completely improbably, and the melodrama ridiculous, and none of the characters were even remotely believable. Too grim to be a comedy, too idiotic to be black humor, this movie has nothing going for it.\n",
      "Let me begin by saying that I enjoyed this movie. It was a light way (despite a few dark moments) to spend a couple of hours, but I wouldn't nominate it for any Oscars, nor would I compare it to the works of Shakespeare as a previous reviewer has.<br /><br />If you wanted to, you could speak as highly of any film. All this would accomplish is to dilute the praise deserving of the real greats (if you're thinking \"Armageddon\", stop reading NOW!)<br /><br />Let's call \"Best Men\" what it really is, a fun little flic. There's some gunplay, a car chase, a guy who gets the girl, a moment of revelation for a would-be lost friend, and a good helping of comic relief, with an ending reminiscent of Richard Gere in \"Breathless\". I enjoyed it, but just because a character is endearingly nicknamed \"Hamlet\", and there's a few (well acted) verses recited, \"Best Men\" is no Shakespearean work.<br /><br />Let's call a spade a spade but reserve the real praise for the likes of Citizen Kane, Lawrence of Arabia, or even Titanic.\n",
      "it starting off okay, but it seemed like the film had an identity crisis for the most part. i suspect that they ran out of money when they were filming and just went with what they had. a big disappointment from tamara davis (although not as big as finding out that she directed a b.spears film - what did mike d think about that?)<br /><br />2/10\n",
      "Truly awful. This is a far departure from \"No Cure For Cancer\". The number one rule for comedians should be: NEVER talk about your kids or pets. Its just not funny.

      "\"Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie\" is a film that has to be seen to be disbelieved. The first film, 1995's \"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie\", brought the six butt-kicking teens from the Fox Kids series to the big screen for the first time. That movie was not all that bad. It had some decent special effects, a somewhat interesting bad guy (Ivan Ooze), and the six young actors who play the Power Rangers were fun to watch. Plus, that film had a bigger budget. But they went back to the cheapness of the TV show with \"Turbo\". The special effects, production design, and costumes are so cheap and cheesy that you wonder why 20th Century Fox gave the go-ahead to let these filmmakers (who are close to the TV show) make this film. Also, the script is much worse than it was in the first movie. Bulk and Skull have more screen time here. It has one of the least interesting villains of all time (actually, a villainess). It's very, very, very, very, very, juvenile. And the Power Ranger actors look as if they want to escape this atrosity. So I have one question. Why did they release this movie to theaters? This should have been released straight to video. Or better yet, release it as a TV movie, were this series started in the first place. This movie was totally inappropriate for the big screen. <br /><br />* (out of four)\n",
      "This movie takes a giant backstep in concept and evolution by replacing our Rangers' powerful Zords (animal attack vehicles) with cheap looking, souped-up cars...and worst of all, the Rangers now wear atrocious looking headlights and reflectors on their heads!<br /><br />\"Turbo\" unfortunately has little going for it. With cheap production values and a boring plot, this big screen vehicle runs out of gas fast...Although the original Power Rangers (Jason, Kimberly, and Tommy) were in it, this film gave them little room for much needed character development. The only good scene in this film was when Rocky (Steve Cardenas) performed a goofy martial arts move that injured his back, and having his place in the martial arts tournament replaced by our heroic Red Ranger Jason (Austin St. John).<br /><br />I have to admit that the new Blue Ranger (a little boy) performed better than his predecessor, but overall, as most sequels go, this film bites the dust. Avoid it like the Black Plague!<br /><br />Movie rating: 1* out of 10*.<br /><br />\n",
      "This movie is one of the typical liberal attempts to rewrite history. It has slaves,Indians,Mexicans and mixed races. Events run from the battle of the Alamo thru Indian wars to the Civil War and then gets to womens suffrage. It's main characters are a rich plantation owner that is part Indian and his daughter who own slaves and her anti-slavery friend that has a slave? and hates Indians. It tries to combine much to much political correctness in way too little time. Of course men are at fault and bashed every 15 minutes. Although most men depicted are wimpy and unrealistic for the time period. I have my disdain for men but I hate to see history warped as this movie depicts. (A regular housewife points out military strategy to General Sam Houston?) Please! Not to mention 50 raiding Indians 15 feet outside a house afraid of 3 women with guns they aren't firing? Half Indian rich plantation owners? I doubt it. Slaves married to Indians? Sheesh. And how did the Indian chief get 50 years older and the girl only gained 10 or 15 years in the same time span? I had to watch this film in 3 sittings as it was laughable to the point of disgust.\n",
      "The role of women in the settling of the frontier has always been, to say the least, underreported. Most films about the settling of the west portray women as either saloon girls--in other words, prostitutes--or virginal school'marm types. One day someone is going to make a good movie about the role of women in the settling of the frontier. Unfortunately, this one isn't it.<br /><br />There are several major problems with this film. First, the script. It's simplistic, overwrought, overheated, preachy and loaded with phony dramatics. Second, there's the sttitude. While most films on this subject pretty much inexcusably ignored women at the expense of men, this one does just the opposite, which is just as inexcusable. There's no real chemistry between Dana Delaney and Powers Boothe, who plays her husband. The rest of the cast is weak, too, and the performances range from adequate to junior high school level. The movie also, for some reason, LOOKS cheap. It has that cheesy look to it that a lot of spaghetti westerns had in the '60s. The whole production looks rushed, like they were running out of money and had to get it done on time.<br /><br />There's a good story to be told here, but the people who made this movie haven't the slightest idea of how to go about it. Avoid this one.\n",
      "This movie is like two or three movie plots all spliced together--and in my eyes, this isn't done in the most successful manner. First, Lionel Atwill orders an up and coming actress to travel to Hollywood with a fading actor. Almost as soon as these two leave, Atwill has a heart attack or something like it and is ordered to take complete rest in the country. He invites along his secretary as his nursemaid and the stage appears to be set for romance at Atwill's country home.<br /><br />However, then it starts to get VERY strange. It seems that Atwill's ranch has a runway with lights and a beacon--very posh indeed. And, it just so happens that BOTH a Bonnie and Clyde style couple are seen nearby and are being chased by the police AND a plane is about to crash because it's almost out of fuel and the only place it can land is at Atwill's landing field!! Talk about ridiculous! Now the Bonnie and Clyde-style couple is an interesting idea I suppose but Wallace Ford is given horrible lines by the writers. In particular, he says \"oke\" (pronounced like \"oak\") about three dozen times when he means to say \"okay\". After a short time, my teeth began to grind every time he said this!! In addition to these creeps, once the plane crashes, the survivors all come into the ranch house and the whole thing plays out like a stage production--with almost all the action happening in one claustrophobia-inducing room. While interesting at times (especially at the thrilling conclusion), the whole thing seems ridiculous, very far-fetched and poorly written--as if desperately needing a massive re-write. Not a great film by any standard, but there were a few good scenes here and there that might hold your interest.<br /><br />Why, oh why, did Wallce Ford need to say \"oke\" again and again and again--it will probably haunt me for some time to come and I'll start avoiding his films!\n",
      "Please spare yourself. It is humorless without merit. The dual role played by the unbearably unwatchable and quasi-intense Fiennes (proving acting is not a genetic trait), is excruciating bizarre and Gretchen Mol must have wondered after and hour of plodding dialog how she was not supposed to realize that the new mysterious Hispanic guy was her old flame. It's really bad. The only faintly amusing scene is where Ray Liotta acts so frustratedly since the rest of the cast were so - duh - lifeless. When he later says he is going to kill everyone I really thought it would be Fiennes, Mol, then the director, the screenplay writer (same guy, maybe), the cameraman before turning it on himself. Even the ending is so cheesy I felt the audience should have been on life-support. I kid you not. Terrible. Not for \"connoisseurs of the simply awful\", it's not that interesting. I'm sorry I couldn't give it less than zero. Some people gave it a ten. How? They misread the instructions? They are in the film, maybe? Liotta would give it a zero, I'm sure. Watch something else!!!\n",
      "\"Forever Mine\" is not a good film. The script is highly formulaic and dull, the characters are one-dimensional, there are several holes in the plot, and the ending manages to be both cliched and unsatisfying. It is worth watching only for two nude scenes from the wonderful and lovely Gretchen Mol, who hasn't done much of that at all. If you're a fan of hers, you won't be disappointed here.<br /><br />Watching this cheese, I was reminded of \"Strange Days\", where Joseph Fiennes' brother Ralph was locked inside a picture almost as bad as this one. The Fiennes brothers certainly can act, and Joseph does his best here to keep the wooden lines fresh. Gretchen Mol lights up the screen no matter what she's in, but one can only wonder why these very good actors are stuck in such a bad movie. Weren't there any more intelligent scripts around to do than this one? Ray Liotta is strictly on auto-pilot for this film.<br /><br />The story here is simple - jealousy, adultery, revenge, etc. Movies like this put some basic elements together, and then count on the magnetism of the stars to enlist the audience's attention. But if the characters have nothing but stupid lines to say, how can we care about them? 4/10, and only Mol's scenes make me go that high.\n",
      "Brazilian Globo TV showed yesterday in it's \"gala\" time this film. Maybe the complete belief in the 'universal' (rather coprophagous) appetite of the masses for a bit of cheap entertainment between reality show \"Big Brother\" and the soporifics Late Hour News...<br /><br />On the other hand, a proof that prestige of American film in general, and of names like Schrader, Liotta, Fiennes are untouched <br /><br />If I write here right now that we took it as a bona fide self-parody, or maybe an attempt to emulate Ed Wood in producing the worst film possible - Yes, things like that are already been said before on this board, as I read above...<br /><br />The best point, to place it, after all, above the 'awfull' grade: It's funny, thanks for some sincere giggles and roar of laughters while the whole evolves - in short, a classic in the \"worst of\" category... (In this mood, don't' miss it!)\n",
      "How could such an accomplished screenwriter, a man who wrote such classics as Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, etc. be so singularly responsible for such an aggravatingly awful movie?<br /><br />I don't think anyone will know. Perhaps the joke is on all of us and Paul Schrader is laughing at our reactions. Maybe he set out to make the worst movie he possibly could and in that it is a triumph.<br /><br />This movie is offensively bad. It will make you mad. A waste of talent, money, time, effort and thought on everyone's part.\n",
      "I saw this film at the Telluride Film Festival. People were walking out, but I stuck it out. Wish I hadn't. Shlocky story, contrived and boring characters. The only thing mildly interesting was to see the revenge plot play out and that was a disapointment as well. Pass on this one.\n",
      "Everything in this movie is unbearably implausible, false, phony. How comes a woman doesn't recognize the man she loves, just 14 years after he's disappeared, and when it happens that much more than half his face looks exactly the same it was? What the hell did the main character do to become so rich and respected? After all, how many cabin boys have become that rich in real life? And, most of all, how comes a young woman like that stays 14 years with the man that has beaten her and, to her knowledge, killed the man of her life? Ridiculous. The screenwriter of Taxi Driver has made a film that is a very good candidate to the title of The Worst Movie Ever Made.\n",
      "I had the displeasure of seeing this movie at the Sundance Film Festival, and my sole purpose of writing this comment is to prevent any sane person from seeing it as well.<br /><br />When I heard of the premise about a mockumentary about the new-found patriotism everybody seemed to have after 9-11, I was definitely looking forward to The War Effort. After almost two hours of poorly done homosexual-dildo jokes (as if they could be done in good taste), horrible improvised \"acting\" performances, and overall immature storyline, I am questioning how this movie could even have been produced in the first place.<br /><br />Perhaps I am being too harsh. If you would like to see a movie that looks to be made by a team of middle-school kids, by all means, enjoy the show!\n",
      "Catherine (Gwyneth Paltrow) is the 27 year-old daughter of a recently deceased mathematician, played by Anthony Hopkins. Catherine grieves for her father who suffered from insanity before he died. Now, she must confront the possibility that she may have inherited some of her father's mental tendencies. One of her father's students, a young man named Herald, as well as Claire, Catherine's scheming sister, make Catherine's life even more difficult. It's been at least a year since I have watched a film so annoying as \"Proof\".<br /><br />You would think that for a film wherein mathematics is a central focus of characters' lives, there would be dialogue references to \"differential equations\", or \"convergent series\", or \"double integral\", or \"binomial expansion\", or other math concepts. Nothing doing. There's some minimal babble about \"prime numbers\". But the film goes out of its way to avoid actual discussion of mathematics.<br /><br />Instead, we have to endure emotional diatribes from Catherine, and her ongoing malaise related to Herald and Claire. Which is itself a contradiction. As a mathematician herself, Catherine's responses should be thoughtful and logical, not emotional. Yet, her reactions are totally emotional and illogical. Clearly, the filmmakers here consider viewers to be mathematical dummies. So they create a phony main character, to enhance verbal conflict, and in so doing evade intellectual dialogue. On the DVD extras, the actors even seem proud that mathematics is not discussed. And that, in turn, made me have an even lower opinion of them.<br /><br />Throughout the film Catherine whines, moans, sulks, and pouts. I absolutely could not stand her. And Gwyneth Paltrow's annoying nasal voice makes her character almost unendurable.<br /><br />A much better movie could have been made if they had dumped Catherine, and zeroed in on the Anthony Hopkins character. Watching him, and listening to him talk about the wonders and mysteries of mathematics with Herald, would have been far more interesting and rewarding.\n",
      "1. What was this earth-shattering paper about? Why did Robert need Catherine to work on it? What techniques made it so hip and prove whatever it was trying to prove?<br /><br />2. \"I feel like I could crack open. Like an egg, or one of those really smelly French cheeses that ooze everywhere when you cut them.\" Gag!<br /><br />3. Robert complains that Catherine didn't get up until noon. If you take care of someone, as she is supposedly doing, you are on their schedule, not yours!<br /><br />4. Catherine is a narcissistic, self-absorbed whiner who doesn't deserve anyone's sympathy.<br /><br />5. Jake Gyllenhaal. How this guy gets work is beyond me! I never bought he could add 2 + 2, much less, was a math whiz! But I did buy he'd bang Catherine so he could make off with the old man's \"sh*t\" to \"write my ticket\"!<br /><br />6. Claire's determination to convince Catherine that she's nuts and put her in the loony bin. What's in it for her?<br /><br />7. Who knew mathematicians are a bunch of drugged-out wack jobs? Sophie Germain must be spinning in her grave!\n",
      "When I rented this flick - despite my prudent dislike - I thought I was going to be served a touchy-feely picture sporting the message that math is not redeeming answer to life but love is, or such Hippy New Age existential hogwash. (Though I prefer that, violent nihilistic self-destruction is the only salvation, as preached by Fight Club) I need bland cotton candy sentiments to balance my diet of bitter misanthropy.<br /><br />Instead I was dished a geriatric smug rendition of \"The Ant and the Grasshopper\" fable. I liked the main-character. The fact that she got up as early as noon, complained about everything and dismissed and alienated people around her with sophomoric clever sophism's and incivility made her a character I could really relate too. In the end though, trough the nagging of her aged father and the boring intervention techniques from her equally boring boyfriend she is swayed to abandon her hobo-hedonistic lifestyle and yielded to the white-collar work-ethics all scientists obey (except she isn't motivated by monomaniacal self-important worship of math and greed of course)<br /><br />Though plaid-shirt wearing math-monkeys feel the sand of human ignorance towards their exalted science grinding in the neat little clock-works of their pedestrian brains, so too my pop-culture filled remnant of gray matter is vexed by the blatant disrespect for human reality , or at least my reality; I never met an interesting mathematician. So I conclude that the lovable socially apt Greenday pet-chimps who know pi to a thousand places are Hollywood creations. (What's next an overrated art-house actor playing a vagrant in a Fantasy world who is the king descending from an ancient bloodline, that fought the Tin Woodsman on steroids in some battle thousands of years ago?)<br /><br />I say; I you want a movie about social and spiritual redemption go watch \"The Fisherking\" by Terry Gilliam, he has something math-monkeys don't have - Imagination.\n",
      "I found the movie so frustrating, I had to turn it off after about 20 minutes. Examples:<br /><br />High-school-level conversation about insanity between two people who are both supposed to be exceptional mathematicians.<br /><br />Ridiculous back-and-forth between Gwyneth Paltrow and Jake Gyllenhaal where they keep changing attitudes and even personalities. I know it's based on a stage play, but couldn't they calm it down a bit for the screen? <br /><br />Lazy screenplay shorthand for bossy woman: talking on cell phone about china patterns while walking through airport. Grrrr! <br /><br />And finally, what made me shut it off: That insane conversation between Paltrow and Hope Davis, where one thinks the other is hallucinating for no apparent reason.\n",
      "Yea sorry folks, but this movie did absolutely nothing for me. A friend of mine told me it wasn't half bad and I expected a good story and figured these actors would not have taken the role if it were bad. I was wrong on all accounts because the story left a lot to be desired, I mean If I had cared about the characters a bit more perhaps I would've like it.<br /><br />Paltrow plays this girl who has taken care of her father for the last few years. Her father (played by Hopkins) was a one time mathematical genius who went crazy. Taking care of her father has made her give up on a lot of her dreams including dropping out of college and she becomes a bit of a headcase herself. One of her father's admirers (Gyllenhaal) wants to go through his memoirs and writing in hopes of finding some sort of amazing proof. <br /><br />Going through his work he finds himself getting closer to the truth and closer to proof that the craziness his teacher had was heretic and that insanity and genius are separated by a very fine line.<br /><br />This movie was a nice change of pace from everything being spoon-fed to us in the theaters these days. I watched it and didn't hate it, but it was rather boring and even for a drama it still was a major let down. I cannot recommend it to anyone, the actors were great and that's about the nicest thing I can say about it, but these actors should've picked better roles and spared us all the load of crap that this movie is.\n",
      "Coming to the IMDb site to review this commercially successful movie, I was amazed at the Oscar recognition it garnered in 1978 for what is, to my eyes and ears a very unremarkable re-make of the enjoyable 1941 Claude Rains feature \"Here Comes Mr Jordan\", while surreptitiously grafting on the title of another \"life after death\" 40's classic starring Don Ameche.<br /><br />I just don't have a lot to say about this vapid entertainment other than apart from transforming the hapless Joe from a boxer to an American footballer (and thus losing some of the universality of his character), it seems almost a line for line, scene for scene, inferior copy of the much superior original. Buck Henry and Elaine May were celebrated comedic writers of the time but I found nothing laugh-out-loud funny in what I saw and heard. The cinematography is merely average, soft focusing around Beatty & Christie's love scenes while the acting gig for all must have been the easiest payday they ever earned. Beatty plays every scene either with bemusement or winsomeness, Christie couldn't even be trusted to adopt an American accent and so we're expected to accept her Transatlantic-hopping English rose character who wins Beatty's heart with one flutter of an eyebrow or flick of her over-permed hair. Add to that the great James Mason seeming to sleepwalk his way in Claude Rains' bigger footsteps, Dyan Cannon in permanent histrionic mode and a cast of many along for the ride. The Oscar nominated score is all sappy MOR muzak too.<br /><br />I've read that Beatty made this film with one eye on the box-office returns to fund his ambitious \"Reds\" project, a film I'll be watching soon and hope was worth it. For me this particular movie just demonstrates however the schmoozy, lackadaisical, condescending work which came out of late 70's LA Hollywood studios.\n",
      "I read a review on Netflix that mentioned there was a menacing mood that permeated throughout The Star Chamber. After 52 minutes, when the plot was finally underway, I was still waiting for something suspenseful. It's not a horrible movie, it's just dull and seemed to go out of its way to avoid action. All the vigilante scenes happen in 30 seconds with some unknown sunglass-wearing white guy. And when they uncover three suspects behind one of the movie's main criminal cases? We're TOLD about their arrest by a third party. There were a lot of little things that didn't quite work (for me, at least)-- The first loophole that Douglas rules on made no sense both logically and legally. All (yes ALL) of the criminals in this movie, no matter their crime, are ridiculously strung out on drugs. The top secret star chamber is located in somebody's house in a room lined with open windows. Yeah I'm being nitpicky, but I was really disappointed by this one, especially given the cast. And why couldn't the judges stop that last hit? They clearly had time and there was no explanation as to how it would compromise their identities. Anyway, hope this helps somebody. Thanks.\n",
      "An absolutely wretched movie. I caught the first twenty minutes of this on the Fox Movie Channel, and was so intrigued that I rushed out and rented it last night, after finishing a 3 1/2 year project.<br /><br />Here are 90 minutes of my life I would love to have back. The film has a splendid cast... Michael Douglas, Hal Holbook, James B. Sikking, Sharon Gless (in a thankless role). It begins intriguingly, like a half-breed of 'The Parallax View' and early Grisham - a high-suspense legal thriller that hits the audience with a gripping, involving problem: a young judge (Douglas) is so faithful to the law that he sends a number of sociopaths free on legal technicalities, and then feels overwhelming guilt when innocent citizens are murdered by the scum he released. This is a wonderful and exciting theme; the judge's guilt and anger are palpable.<br /><br />But the film spends the remaining hour jerking the audience around so frantically that the viewer will feel like jerking back. It goes out of its way to convince the audience that an \"illegal\" problem introduced to solve its early dilemma -- (a secret society of dissatisfied judges who murder the scuzzbags who have been let loose) is justifiable and laudable, then it doubles back and spends the rest of the movie contradicting itself, trying to prove that such a solution is morally repugnant.<br /><br />What the hell??!! <br /><br />The result: one feels a sense of overwhelming nausea and depression. The film traps the viewer in a depressing web of nihilistic futility.<br /><br />I also found the subplot involving two child murderers and the glimpses of a child's bloodied, severed leg unspeakably depressing.<br /><br />This is one to avoid.\n",
      "Put yourself in this position: You're a 30-something judge with a wife and kids whose job is to send people to jail. But when small technicalities get in the way of justice, you have to compromise your morals and let rapists and murderers on the loose--just because the police may have performed a search without a warrant, or taken garbage out of a truck before the lever was pressed and it was dumped into the back with everyone else's trash, thereby becoming \"trash\" and not the garbage of a certain individual.<br /><br />You'd probably feel pretty depressed knowing that confessed criminals are being let loose because of a small error in their arrest procedure, right?<br /><br />Well, that's how Michael Douglas feels in \"The Star Chamber,\" a film about an underground society of judges who are able to convict felons based solely upon what they did--and not on whether they were unjustly apprehended at the time of their arrest.<br /><br />After having to let two child murderers go free on a slight technicality, Stephen Hardin (Douglas) decides to join an underground community of judges who take matters into their own hands when bad guys are let free--by hiring hitmen to assassinate them. If you think this sounds improbable, you're right. If you think it sounds morally wrong, you're partially right.<br /><br />The movie knows that audiences would immediately interpret this as sick, or twisted, so Peter Hyams--the director--uses some of the oldest cliches in the book to make us empathize with Stephen. First, we see him let a murderer go after the police who arrested him acted wrongly in the arrest procedure. Then we see the two child murderers let loose on a similar technicality. I'd buy this if it seemed real--but the script is all one big contrivance. It doesn't feel real; it makes the viewer feel manipulated.<br /><br />Now, I like films that provide deep characters that we learn to feel attached to. I think that's why character-driven films such as \"Fargo\" and \"Planes, Trains and Automobiles\" succeed. And I don't feel personally insulted when a film tries to make us empathize with its characters by having them go through certain events. But this just feels fake, and I didn't buy the trial scenes for a minute. Too quick, too stupid, too darn silly.<br /><br />Would two similar cases appear in front of a judge within a few days? This is the type of trial case that makes the news and is a one-in-a-million-type ordeal--you'd see it advertised everywhere in big bold print--yet the movie approaches it as if it's an everyday event in the life of a judge. Stephen's older mentor tells him that he's had to do the same type of thing an uncountable number of times. Really? Name a few cases.<br /><br />The entire notion of an underground band of judges who rule out their own personal judgments sounds like a cross between a John Grisham novel and one by Stephen King. I believe that Grisham could handle this with a bit of credibility--but the film approaches the matters as King approaches material: It doesn't make much sense to begin with, and really withers away in the second half. (I loved \"The Running Man\" novel up until the last hundred pages.)<br /><br />Alas, \"The Star Chamber\" is directed with lack of feeling and emotion. If it had setup characters we could care for in more believable situations, then perhaps I would have felt that Stephen's adventures with the underground community of redneck judges would actually mean something. But after all, what does one expect from a film directd by Peter Hyams? Not much.<br /><br />I hope this idea gets re-done a few years from now. It's an intriguing premise. Too bad it had to be ruined by such a terrible director in such a terrible film.<br /><br />2/5 stars.<br /><br />- John Ulmer\n",
      "Hackneyed, shapeless anthology from the bargain basement. The six tales (that's six on my tape) are all shot outside, all dialogue-lite and all appalling. They were clearly made by people who'd only just found a video camera. Indeed, you actually see the camera twice reflected in surfaces. Vincent Price must have taped his contribution in a single morning and probably didn't remember it a week later. Waste not your time on this. The box says on the back 'in the tradition of The Twilight Zone' - in their dreams. How about saying 'In the tradition of a particularly bad, 80s, made for television scatty fantasy horror which are deeply tedious and insignificant'?\n",
      "It is sad to see the previously great Vincent Price attach himself to the front and back end of this amateurish production of silly & sad non-spooky shorts. He's in there briefly at the front, and briefly at the end, but the stuff inbetween was made by hacks.\n",

      "One of the cleverest and most suspense filled books I've ever read. I just had to see if there was a movie. Lovecraft drops barely enough information about the world he's creating to keep you hooked. By the end of the book you'll be aching to know more but be content with it's quick rise in revelations. <br /><br />So after seeing all the totally unnecessary artistic license taken by the adaptation of the story - things that turn an epic and suspenseful story into an action-hero-vehicle and gore-fest - I wanted to invoke the cryptic invocation whose heading is the Dragon's Tail, sign of the descending node - OGTHROD AI'F GEB'L-EE'H YOG-SOTHOTH 'NGAH'NG AI'Y ZHRO! - reducing the movie to a fine powder.\n",
      "I'm really confused by other users comments. After reading them I ordered a copy from the states as fast as my fingers could click to Amazon. I'm a huge fan of Lovecraft and to be told that this is the best film adaption of his work and that I'd never even heard of it made me think I was about to get my slime covered tentacles on a forgotten gem. Then it arrived and I must ask the other users, are you all completely bonkers? This is a terrible, terrible film. It's badly lit, shot, edited, acted and scripted. When the femme non fetale first arrives at the PI's office it's this dreadful side shot which just sits there for about five minutes while the two of them fail to act in each others general direction from the opposite sides of the screen. The rest of the film seems to consist of either seen it all before POV's or more of these overly lit side shots, I thought Dan O'Bannon could shoot films? Thank god the flashbacks break up the boredom. In a voice over Ward's wife says something like \"He just left the party and said he had to do some work that couldn't wait\", at which point Ward in the flashback says \"I have to leave the party to do some work that cannot wait.\" Brilliant! It goes on like that for an hour and forty tedious minutes with a couple of goofy and gooey effects don't liven up the proceedings one bit, until it ends with Chris Sarandon hamming it up for all he's worth while I considered hanging myself from the tedium of it all. Come on guys, us Lovecraft fans have to be forgiving occasionally by the general low quality and/or budgets of his related movies, but we shouldn't let this film off the hook just because it sticks fairly close to the original story. I mean, Dagon is rubbish but at least it's FUN rubbish, this is just plain dull.\n",
      "This movie is exceedingly faithful to Lovecraft's original story, and I loved the original story (\"The Case of Charles Dexter Ward\"). So why did I dislike the film so much? Essentially, because it's NOT an \"adaptation\" of the source material: It's a straight line-by-line reconstruction of it, with no concessions of any note made to the adaptation process, to the differences in story telling technique which are required for film, as opposed to the written word.<br /><br />In short, it's uncinematic and what works on the printed page does not - most definitely does NOT - work on the flickering screen unmodified. The end result is tedious in the extreme.\n",
      "I am usually a big fan of most horror movies Dan O bannon is assoicated with { from Dead and Buried to Return of the Living Dead } and I had high expectations for this film. First off, this film is almost 2 hours long but the material contained within the film does not support that long of a time frame. In fact, it takes 56 minutes for the 1st real exciting visual scene to happen. The actor that portrays the investigator is quite amateurish while the lead that plays the female part is awful { take not of the beginning when she is in the detectives office and they are talking. Her performance is pathetic and she plays with her hands for 5 minutes} . The dialog leaves little to be desired and there's nothing inventive or unique about the camera-work. The soundtrack is very uneventful. I have no idea how people can rate movies like this a \" 10\" . In many ways this is a poor mans Reanimator. If you must see this film, just fast forward the 1st 55 minutes and start from there and even then you may feel very disastified.\n",
      "... and if this abomination of a movie is a honestly true adaptation as the previous reviewers claim, I really don't ever plan on reading Lovecraft... ever.<br /><br />I like to start out with the high points. The lighting was very well done... nicely atmospheric. The cinematography was well realized, considering the apparent lack of talent on the directors part. The set design was pretty nice as well.<br /><br />Unfortunately, that is about the end of the positives. The acting was sub-par at best. The actors in this production have proved themselves to be competent in previous productions. Either the director of this movie had no control over his talent, or his talent gave him way too much control over their performances. Then there is the story. The person responsible for this awful, plodding adaptation needs to read a little more about plot and character development, not to mention the basics of suspension of disbelief. Okay, I understand that the story is about a 250 year old doctor who was brought back from the dead. I am willing to take that leap of faith. What I cannot understand are the little things. The main character, a private investigator, somehow is allowed to accompany police officers on a night-time raid of a dark farmhouse that reeks of death... then assumes the role of hostage negotiator while there is a half dozen armed police officers standing right behind him. And how many high security psych wards do you know of that will walk an unscheduled visitor into a criminally insane inmates padded cell (with it's own window btw) without searching the visitors large suitcase to see if might contain any weapons or drugs or human skeletons... It those little things that are the most insulting to the viewer. Even though it is a sci-fi/horror flick, we in the audience aren't retarded. We expect our fantasies to be somewhat grounded in reality.<br /><br />If this movie ever comes on Cinemax, by all means it's worth a watch. I have seen worse in my time. But if you are thinking of renting this movie and you are not a die-hard Lovecraft fan, save your money... really.\n",
      "I was watching this movie, and at first, I was enjoying it and finding it somewhat powerful. The dance sequences were undoubtedly remarkable and as were the performances. I began to enjoy watching it, but about two- thirds of the way through, I began to get tired of the sappy bonds between Baryshikov's and Hines's characters. Also, the escape scenes give the movie an unneeded \"Hurry up, GO GO!\" feel to it. It is frustrating to know how good this film could have been with how remarkable the performers are and with its powerful storyline.\n",
      "First, I would like to voice my outrage at the exploitation of Vladimir Vysotsky's talent five years after his death for this piece of Reagan-esquire propaganda. Another dehumanization of the USSR, especially when it was it had only 6 years of existence left. Another contrived plot that has nothing in common with reality. If an artist defected, they would not try to pull him back, this would be beneath them. Besides, he is not a government worker or a military officer--- he does not have any secrets that they would want to keep him quiet about it. This is \"so-called\" art done for the benefit of Reagan's propaganda. If Americans want to see what Russian society was really like, they should see any of the Soviet films(PREFERABLY of the 60's, 70.s, and 80's) found in abundance on this website.\n",
      "\"Tre Solar\" could have been the top Swedish movie of the year, instead it is rather the low-point for the last five years. It's surprising why - we have the current Swedish actor elites, nice filming and authentic outfits and environments. Yet, tre solar doesn't pull much off - due to the really lame script. For minutes barely ANYTHING happens. Woman walks in, sees man, talks to him, he answers in absent words, tragic discover. Next scene. Repeats again. I have absolutely no idea what went wrong during the production, but it seems very strange to me that actors with such experience as these, making all the top roles in recent movies, wouldn't see this coming. Perhaps \"Tre Solar\" is the perfect example of the majority of Swedish films - some wish-to-be-made movie is granted financial support not because it is something people want to see on the big screen, but rather because it seems like an interesting aim to some people (namely the academy granting money to support Swedish film-making). Much as it pains me, but Tre Solar cannot earn more than 2/10 by me.\n",
      "** IF POSSIBLE THERE ARE SPOILERS HERE **<br /><br />Hanna has lived for four years alone with her kids since her husband went abroad to join a crusade (or something like it). Now, a messenger brings the news that her husband is coming home and she leaves her village to go to the harbor to greet him. But danger lurks everywhere, the plague has come to the land. Hanna meets a lot of characters along her journey (which seems to go on forever without getting anywhere). She meets Joel, who has lost his family to the plague and a she meets a girl, abused as sacrifice by a corrupted priest. She meets the imprisoned Torben and the abandoned Emma, whose husband has closed the city gates and refuses to let anyone in. Finally she finds her husband Ulf, but the once powerful and happy man is now an addict to some foreign substance, barely able to speak. Hanna feels that her husband has betrayed her and leaves him, just to come back a few days later to pick him up again. Then the girl get struck by the plague and everything seems to go wrong at once...<br /><br />A movie with lot of known and good Swedish actors, but many has small roles. This is a road movie, set in medieval times, without any roads. The main character goes around thinking, contemplating and meeting different characters. There are many long shots of riding and few with any real action. The plot becomes very slow and dull. When Hanna actually meets anyone, it seems like all suspense and emotions that lack from other parts must be said in just one sentence. This gives greeting sentences with threats of rape and murder as the norm which seems very uncharacteristic. The dialog which could bring the plot forward instead seem odd and stupid. In addition, Hanna seems inconsistent with herself and her own motives. The only good things are that Lena Endre seem to try to do her best with the material she haves, and that the scenery and outfits are good. However, a real dull experience.<br /><br />3/10\n",
      "Sorry about my crappy English. It isn't easy to write this comment without laughing...<br /><br />And the award for worse wig ever goes to... The entire cast of \"Tre Solar\"!<br /><br />I don't think I've ever laughed this much to a Swedish movie before and I doubt that I ever will. This is so bad that... that... I can't find the words to describe how awful this really is. Throughout the entire film I excpected Terry Gilliam & C/o to show up, banging coconuts together, pretending to ride imaginary horses.<br /><br />Finally, I beg to the producers to NEVER ever show this film outside Swedish boarders. We can't let anybody think Swedish cinema stinks this much. Because if you do, nobody is gonna give us foreign money so we can film the books about Arn.\n",
      "I came here and read the reviews before I watched this on TV last night. After reading the bad reviews here I thought \"it can't be that bad surely, it is at least watchable for novelty value... I like nordic films so from that perspective sure I can get something out of it...\". I wish I hadn't wasted my time. It is 100 mins of really badly scripted, utterly irrational nonsense about someone who the script writers can't decide how her emotions and actions should resemble each other, in a continuous manner with regards to the plot, and therefore ends up looking ridiculous and being forgettable. (Forgettable other than the fact I will continue to rue wasting 2 hrs of my life).<br /><br />There is just no point to this movie. And no I don't \"not get it\", but what's it about? A woman loves her husband? not overly deep. Human relationships? The weakest movie on this topic I have seen for quite a while. A history movie? The era and the plague don't come in to it at all other than excuses to make the ridiculous script lines excusable on the basis of something like \"it's set centuries ago, people talked crazily back then\". A middle-ages Odyssee? Stick with the ancient Greek one.<br /><br />I am just glad I can't speak Swedish (and had to read subtitles), when you listen to the talking you can just tell it would be even more embarrassing to listen to it proper than it would be reading the subtitles.\n",
      "Alot of the negative criticism this movie has gotten seems to concentrate on the wigs. Personally I don't think that's got anything to do with why the movie isn't good. The wigs didn't bother me at all actually. Overall I thought the whole production seemed quite serious and it looked good to me and didnt detract from the movie.<br /><br />The thing that puts this movie down is the script and directing. It's absolutely terrible. And I'm not kidding here. It seems like something I wrote back in fourth grade. And the way they try to put humour into it. It's pretty hilarious, not due to the jokes, but due to it being so utterly ridiculous.<br /><br />And it's not particularly true to that age either. I mean people didn't call the plague \"the plague\" back then. They called it the \"big death\". Also they had no idea that the rats were the ones spreading the disease either so there's no reason for the characters of the movie to fear the rats so much.<br /><br />I dont really know what this movie wants. It seems like half of the time they're trying to have a history lesson and the other they're trying to be funny. And inbetween they're just riding on horses. There's no red line connecting it at all. I'll admit it gave me a few laughs but that was mostly due to the horses having so short legs making them look ridiculous when they galloped. But all in all this isn't a movie to see if your not a moviebuff like myself.<br /><br />3/10\n",
      "This was the first Swedish movie (except Josef Fares' movies and Vuxna Människor) that I saw from the beginning to the end. Not because it was exciting or incredibly interesting, but because our extremely boring Swedish teacher forced my class to see it.<br /><br />After have seen Tre Solar I have also come to the conclusion that she also had extremely bad taste.<br /><br />Why Tre Solar is awful: 1. The script was probably printed on an A3-paper, there are approximately 3 lines in this movie. 2. The props is horrible, maybe because of the low budget or a lack of inspiration. 3. The actors are showing a complete lack of knowledge about acting.<br /><br />All of this results in Tre Solar being an excruciating horrible and sad, sad movie.<br /><br />It is also sad to see that splendid actors such as Rolf Lassgård and Rikard Wolf chose to participate in this movie.\n",
      "Kyle (Jack Wagner) is a police officer who doesn't seem to have any partner but his crime-fighting dog, Hunter. The adorable canine loves doughnuts as much as the next man in blue but truly is talented at sniffing out trouble. One night, Kyle and Hunter are tracking an outlaw when the dog runs ahead of his partner. With an evil glint in his eye, the bad guy shoots the poor dog and mortally wounds him. Although Kyle takes him to his usual vet (Daphne Zuniga), Hunter doesn't make it, making both owner and doc weep profusely. However, a short time later, Kyle is surprised and delighted to find that the \"ghost\" of hunter is haunting his digs and trying to communicate with him. Trotting off to a medium, Kyle participates in a seance that virtually drives the dog's spirit into the seer's adult male son. From that moment, the young man acts like a dog but speaks English and tries to offer advice on how to catch the villain who shot him. Can they find the evil one? This movie is just ridiculous. The idea of a ghost dog is not bad but to have him inhabit the body of a human and parade around like a character from the Jungle Book is simply stupid. Wagner, however, is a looker and so is Zuniga so there's that. Also, when the dog himself is on the screen or his friends, animal lovers will be happy as well. The sets, costumes and production values are fine but nothing makes up for the preposterous premise. That said, if you love animals and or cool looking guys, you might want to get this one for an evening's diversion. But, it is almost a certainty that you will never watch the blasted thing again.\n",
      "We couldn't tell if this movie was designed for little kids or kids and undemanding adults. It was a mess for sure. Kiddie plot, grainy and cheap production values and a lot of very bad overacting. Daphne Zuniga and Jack Wagner actually looked embarrassed to be there. Even for PAX-TV this was a low-brow entry. It looked more like a Disney Channel Saturday morning show.<br /><br />\n",
      "I was duped into thinking that this was an actual movie. Had I known it was a tv-movie I would have spent the $2.50 rental fee elsewhere. The jacket of the movie made it look like it'd be funny...but I was WRONG! I didn't even laugh once during the entire flick and I'm a person who laughs during a funny movie, even if its as stupid as watching Wiley E. Coyote blowing himself up!<br /><br />Others may say this is a good family movie, but I wouldn't even let my own kids watch this movie!\n",
      "I don't think anyone who watches this movie or who actually pays attention to the world around them would argue that Fox News is truly \"fair and balanced.\" This documentary sets out to prove in numerous ways how Fox News is a well rehearsed, talking-points-fed propaganda arm for the right wing.<br /><br />The problem is not with the message but with the film-making. This movie is a glorified Power Point presentation. And thats putting it nicely. Most of the footage from Fox News is not even taken from broadcast quality sources but rather DVRs and clips from the internet. It looks and sounds HORRIBLE. The graphics (which is the bulk of the movie) are cheap, tacky, cheesy, and totally lessen the impact of the important points that are often being made.<br /><br />I realize that those on the fringe, seeking change are not very popular and thus won't have millions to make a glossy movie. But that does not mean that if you take your time, plan, and above all be creative, you can't make a good movie. And thats the problem, this movie is all message and no craft. And to me, that sort of negates the purpose of documentaries. Because if it was ONLY about the message, then write an editorial in a major newspaper. Documentary film-making is about combining message and style, and using the two to heighten and sharpen one another. None of that happens here. I made stuff in high school with fart jokes in it shot on VHS that was better than this.\n",
      "This was a pretty bad movie. I'm a political liberal, I hate Fox News for reasons that go beyond their political viewpoint, and I like documentaries - and still I thought this was a pretty bad movie. It's guilty of a few of the tricks it picks on Fox for using (fast graphics meant to \"wow\" and confuse) and adds a few others to the arsenal (interviewing mostly people whose views of Fox may be tainted by personal grudge; taking quotes from news shows out of context; using montages rather than quantitative data to sway the audience). Furthermore, nothing they said was newsworthy - Fox is conservative? Bill O'Reilly is a self-righteous jerk? Who would've guessed?? And the filming technique just wasn't interesting at all - the only \"interesting\" thing was the complete absence of any directorial narration, and that was the bad kind of interesting. If you find yourself inspired to go see it, donate the $7 it'd cost you to a left-wing think tank instead and save yourself the ninety minutes of vague annoyance and boredom.\n",
      "First of all, let me just say I can't stand Fox News. I think it's nothing but right-wing propaganda and a shameful excuse for journalism. I also think a documentary exposing Fox's hypocrisy is much needed, but this one is an extremely poor effort.<br /><br />Frankly, I am SHOCKED at the amount of people rating this movie a 9 or 10. People, these ratings are supposed to be based on the QUALITY of the movie, not the ideas it stands for. And quality is one thing this movie lacks. For starters, the interviews are the worst I've ever seen. They are poorly lit, and consist of nothing but the same talking heads over and over again, which becomes really tiresome. The graphics and music are painfully cheesy. The sound quality is horrible, the dialogue is usually out of synch, and even the clips from Fox News look extremely poor, like they've been taken straight from the Internet. The entire movie looks and feels a high school film project at best, and (as another user pointed out) a Powerpoint presentation at worst. I understand it's on a low budget, but the fact that the director has a career going back decades makes the lack of style or creativity especially outrageous. You'd think in all that time he'd have learned a thing or two about, say, lighting a shot.<br /><br />Technical stuff aside, even the movie's basic argument (Fox is biased and unfair in its reporting) is weak. I never thought the day would come when I'd be defending Fox News, but it has to be said that many of the clips are taken out of context or otherwise distorted. For example, most of the scenes of anchors spouting wild opinions are taken from Fox's political talk shows. Fox has NEVER claimed these shows are to be seen as news, but that's what the movie keeps implying. It's as unfair as anything Fox has ever reported.<br /><br />An even better example of the blatant distortion is when they show Bill O'Reilly responding to criticism that he always tells his guests to \"shut up.\" O'Reilly says this only happened once, and this is followed by a montage of him yelling \"shut up!\" at different times. Well, that's very clever, except that in almost all of these instances he's not actually talking to a guest. We even see the infamous moment where he yelled at Al Franken on a book tour, which had NOTHING to do with Fox News AT ALL. Do all these clips indicate that O'Reilly is an obnoxious moron? Sure. Does it indicate that he's lying about only telling a guest to shut up once? Nope. Just the opposite, in fact.<br /><br />The movie has some good points to make, and occasionally does so effectively, but the overall distortion, low quality, lack of narration, and complete lack of a sense of humor bring this one down. I suspect that the people rating this so highly were either directly involved with the making of the movie, or are just flakes who will jump at the chance to support anything remotely anti-right. Ignore the hype; this is simply a bad movie. 4/10 stars.\n",
      "I enjoyed watching this documentary, which was essentially a list of left-wing personalities beating up on Fox News and Bill O'Reilly. Their point was that Fox is not objective and pushes a right-wing agenda.<br /><br />The film was interesting and I liked hearing about the internal memos they were able to put together. The confrontation between O'Reilly and Jeremy Glick was also interesting, and I had not seen that before to the best of my recollection.<br /><br />The documentary is flawed, however. Flawed primarily by a low budget (the editing and graphics are very amateur), but two major problems come to mind. First, it is clearly aimed at a liberal audience. While this will make the target audience (including me) happy, it will teach them very little. Most of the facts are not shocking to those on the left.<br /><br />But more importantly, the film sets out to show Fox News bias. It succeeds in this, but also shows us an intense bias of its own. I do not feel any facts were altered or left out, but a \"documentary\" with thirty or so prominent liberals talking about Fox without a single pro-Fox person to make a statement seems very poor. Had a few Fox people been interviewed, the film would have been much stronger. Why attack something that can't fight back? But it's not a bad film, and you should see it before Bush leaves office and the film loses relevance. I saw it for free as a free rental to go with \"Amelie\", maybe you might consider the same.\n",
      "This movie is certainly not what you would call a well constructed Documentary film. It is very clear in it's motives and I guess succeeds in keeping the viewer entertained throughout the entire Movie. I wouldn't go so far as comparing it to Michael Moore's way of commenting through film, but it tends to take that direction at times.<br /><br />That being said, it is still, unfortunately, a Movie Americans should watch and take to heart. Because at the core of it all it's not about politics, the movie makers are (hopefully) not trying to berate Fox News for being Right Wing. What is important about this movie and what should be important to every American, left, right, center, black, white, Hispanic, is that this is the way Journalism is nowadays in the States. And that this kind of Journalism SHOULD NOT BE SUPPORTED. It doesn't matter if it's CNN or NBC or FOX. You DO NOT! invite Guests onto your show and then cut off their Microphones when they voice an opinion that is different to your own. You DO NOT! deny your studio guests the right to speak. You DO NOT! DO NOT! DO NOT! put your Opinion in front of the facts. Never ever ever ever... That is not Journalism, and deserves to be removed from the Air for all eternity. It is unprofessional, insensitive Manipulation of FACT! And let's face it, it's an Outrage. It makes me as a viewer feel like an idiot, because I am being pushed very unsubtly into an opinion which may not even be mine. And that should NEVER be the case on any Newsprogramm anywhere.<br /><br />The Problem with a film like this is that it raises too much emotion to be really taken seriously. The Left will cheer it to high heavens, even though it is neither a good film, nor an unbiased representation of facts. And the Right will see it as \"Left-wing Propaganda Rubbish\" and not see behind the facade through to the real issue at hand. If everyone would watch this movie, take a second to think about what they feel, and then take out of it the message that rings true to them, this movie will have had the effect a journalistic piece should have, even though I doubt that is the effect it was aiming at.<br /><br />I have been a supporter of our President for the entirety of his term, I share a lot of the views Fox News is trying to convey, heck sometimes I even share the same Opinion that O'Reilly does, and do think some of his guests should just shut up. But I wanna decide whether or not I switch of the news. But a journalist should have his pride, a journalist should show some class. It is NOT the Job of a News Corporation to make this decision for you.\n",
      "I really loved the first seasons of the Simpsons, but I think their humour is not fresh anymore. This episode is another proof. The magic that The Simpsons had was trasfering into scene simple situations of the everyday life but in a funny way. The new chapters are about extravagant situations which make no sense at all. The Ronaldo dialogue is annoying, the chapter has a lot of emphasis on a boring online game. Then we have the typical opinions of the writers about various subjects like Christopher Colombus discovery being insignificant or football making whole continents insane, those are also quite annoying, specially because of the emphasis they are given.\n",
      "This episode seemed weak and far fetched.<br /><br />We follow Marge Simpson who have discovered an online roleplaying game called Earth Realms. Soon she discovers that almost every single inhabitant of Springfield plays that exact game, and that her son is a highly feared villain in the game.<br /><br />This part is absurd in many ways and bare very little resemblance to how real online roleplaying games are played. This makes a mockery of the younger audience, who can easily see that the script writers doesn't waste time on research. Of course you can say that since it is a satiric comedy primarily for adults, it does not have to be accurate. But I fail to see why not. They could easily have made the same story portraying a real MMORG (Massive multiplayer roleplaying game) without using every cliché in the book.<br /><br />In this episode we also follow Lisa Simpson who have found a liking for football (soccer for you Americans). Homer Simpson steps in as a referee and all kind of hysterical comedy ensues... That is if you think that showing an stereotypical American who doesn't understand the rules of football is funny. This part is even more absurd. The only thing we get out of it is, that it is important to play fair and that European football is tainted by violent supporters. Brazilian football star Ronaldo appears as a guest star, but that is both unnecessary and not funny at all. One has to ask why he is there at all. He bares no real significance to the storyline, and he is so out of place that one has to wonder if the writers just wanted somebody famous to be in the show.<br /><br />The whole episode fails miserably to deliver on the comedy side, and all we get is a quaint and poorly written episode that portraits both online role playing games and football in an inept and naive way, lacking the usual finesse and relevance.\n",
      "I, like several others, was inspired to write my first review because of this film's blatant failure to deliver.<br /><br />Having been treacherously lured into watching this film by some of my \"friends\" with the premise of its potent quality, I was genuinely shocked at how disappointing and frankly boring it was.<br /><br />Let us clarify something. What constitutes a \"good\" or \"bad\" movie is quite relative. However, *all* good movies share basic elements that provide the foundation for making them good. Superior movies introduce these elements with such dynamic tension and intensity that it truly sets them apart from inferior movies. For example, some of these elements can be \"conflict\" or \"character progression\" or even \"resolution of said conflict through a character's progression\" (the possibilities are endless!) This movie was lacking these elements. The plot is so terribly vacant that there is simply no conflict. Nearly all the events are unjustified or left unexplained.<br /><br />What begins as a somewhat interesting premise turns flat and dull early on. The big \"shock\" being that the two conflicted sides of Good and Evil are not so different is quite cliché and ordinary by today's standards. Decent movies that have touched on this idea at least possessed the ability to convey that message indirectly with added tension and development of suspense, where as this movie has its characters simply blurting out this intended message because the incoherent plot fails to do so.<br /><br />The biggest problem is that the large scale conflicts are not felt. There is no clear dispute between good and evil. There are no more than four or five characters for each Dark or Light whom have absolutely no character development or substance and constantly give the impression of always being replaceable. The \"big\" apocalyptic event is simply solved by a 29 Year old virgin saying, \"I did it.\" Ummm...WHAT?!?!? It doesn't make sense. It really doesn't.<br /><br />There are so many smaller plot holes that are never answered its ridiculous. At the end of this movie I find myself asking, \"What was the point?\"\n",
      "This is by far the most awful movie I have ever seen. Not a single scene made at any sense at all, everything was rushed and confusing, no one explained the world of the story besides \"there's a war going on between night watchers and day watchers\". The picture was out of focus all the time, the music was really distracting.<br /><br />Every detail in Nochnoy Dozor we have already seen, most of the times much better. I'm talking about Lord of the rings, the Matrix, Blade, Constantine, the X-Files, Star Wars ... This movie is not independent or new and I definitely won't watch its sequels.<br /><br />Why did it get so good ratings and reviews? Must be because it's a Russian production ...\n",
      "This film is the worst film of the year so far.<br /><br />The whole film seems rather disjointed and is unbelievably dull.<br /><br />It consists of bad written script and broken storyline, poor soundtrack, too many bad quality special effects, humble acting.<br /><br />I have read the book after watching a movie and got some clues about the original plot. Book is excellent, but it does not make a film better. I guess film only was based on the book, and truly fails to deliver any storyline. <br /><br />I would say most of you could skip \"Nochnoj dozor\" and save your time and money. <br /><br />So Bad It Hurts!\n",
      "I'm sure this was a better movie in its native language but when dubbed in English it's impossible to understand. Either it's very abstract or the director and all the actors are completely stoned out of their minds, the movie is like a neverending seizure with cuts every two seconds and a poorly explained story involving (from what I can discern) crazy Russian vampires and some epic struggle between light and dark...<br /><br />I watched this at night with a good friend who was equally unimpressed, and we still have no idea what this movie is about. The whole time I just wanted it to end. Please never watch this, I actually consider this the worst movie ever made.<br /><br />Unbearable. 1/10\n",
      "Night Watch is a low budget Russian vampire movie that depicts the eternal battle of good and evil in modern day Moscow. Centuries after a truce between two opposing forces there is a risk that an 'Other' or gifted human (anyone seen Neo?) will tip the balance of power. As with the vampire movie Underworld there are forces that prevent the battle from spilling over into the real world. The Day Watch are vampires assigned to police their brethren who disguise themselves as Adidas tracksuit wearing chavs who drive Audi TTs and aspire to be pop stars (the UK is full of Vampires!). The Night Watch must step in to prevent evil forces from doing harm to innocent humans. The special effects in the movie are decent and one would be forgiven for mistaking the movie as a Hollywood title at times. However, there are other instances when it looks as though the movie is being acted out by a bunch of friends in a warehouse or derelict flat. The cheap grainy feel is likely to be part of the desired Gothic, art house effect so many will however enjoy its raw non glossy appeal. Whilst most sci fi/ horror fans will be instantly attracted to the story there is not a great deal of depth to the plot or characters and there is the strong feeling that you are being set up for sequel. The movie also moves very slowly at times and the surreal action can be confusing. Whilst some would argue that this adds complexity and intrigue it cant really mask the lack of depth in the story line or characters and will not somehow make it more interesting than it really is. The special effects also often seem to be on display rather than interwoven with plot. There is an interesting end to the movie but the film has been dragged out for too long by its conclusion for you to care. Overall an interesting movie that is likely to herald the start of a potentially significant contribution from Russia to the international action genre but as a stand alone entity it is average at best.\n",
      "This movie is way over-hyped. I tried to get into it twice before I finally forced myself to watch it all the way through. I understand why it was noticed in America, though. It's presented like a typical Hollywood sandwich: one side slathered with sloppy special effects, the other with fast-paced action sequences. Drop The Matrix, Saw, and Underworld in a blender and this is what you get.<br /><br />The story feels contrived and is too convoluted for its own good. Many of the scenes are loosely connected to one another, making the story hard to follow. Using existing mythological archetypes (vampires, witches, etc.) is a fine attempt at helping the audience accept the other world presented by the story, but cracks at freshness are mostly failures. Nothing in this movie feels original.<br /><br />I don't hate this movie, but I don't think it's worth watching either. I've seen it done before and I've seen it done better.\n",
      "Like most viewers who saw the English theatrical trailer of Night Watch, they too may have been enthralled by the horror and action. Possibly one of the better story lines of the genre; I loved the idea of the balance between light and dark/good and evil, the special effects at times where pretty cool, the twist was unexpected (to me at least) and the way it sets up the sequels is also commendable. But, whether or not the filming company neglected to give the required amount of money to make this movie a blockbuster annoys me. The cinematography was a huge let down; no special angels or dark contrast, although the startwas OK, but a bit too nice for me. A horror needs to be scary at all times. Also, guns would have been good.<br /><br />Overall, the storyline would have truly transformed this trilogy into an epic, but whether it was lack of funds or lack of cameras, this was the biggest let down I can remember. Until there is a remake by someone like Peter Jackson or Ridley Scott with $100m in funding, the potential brilliance of this film will remain hidden.\n",
      "****Minimal Spoilers here***********<br /><br />What is it about some movies that make me want to write an essay about them? Some are so good, some are the opposite. Night Watch is of the latter kind. It sucks and it took me three trials to finish it since I kept falling asleep and having to restart it. It has so many bad qualities in a high-end-should've-been-good production that it makes me mad. A director given in Russian cinema standards- major resources and he comes up with this quagmire. <br /><br />The plot line is muddled, dumb and makes no sense. It's not that I did not 'get it'. I do get it. It's just that the basic story here is old and worn about the battle of good and evil. Well, OK, we can make something interesting with that. However we move into two subplots about a cursed woman who is bringing a vortex down to earth. Why? Who the hell knows. More lame is the 'climax' for this vortex story line. If that is not the definition of an anti-climax I do not know what is. We also have the vampire-seduced kid plot line that seems to wind around and around before the ultimate non-climax. Along the way we meet mini-characters. I say 'mini' because we know little to nothing about them and then they are gone. I would've loved to see more of the blood drinking butcher, even a little deeper insight into Olga the owl would've been interesting. Other incidents that beg some logical questions, why did the power station explode so fast after what's-his-name got the news about his mommy? How on earth did the power come back on after that huge explosion? Maybe Texas power sent Moscow some like they did NY last year? How about the singer and her skinny crony? What exactly was their role? What about the crazy plane that was pretty much crashing, barely feet from the ground, and then we don't see it till the disaster is averted and it lands safely some 20 minutes later? It felt like Mr. Bekmambetov (Mr. B) was going too fast to bother with tiny details",
      "<br /><br />I would've given this a better review even with the huge plot ADD had it been better filmed. Sure we get some very good CGI here and there. Unfortunately the insane pace of cutting from one shot to the next when there's action going on will cut on anyone's enjoyment and attention. I almost got a headache in that last lame duel between Anton (was that a neon light he was wielding????!!) and Zavulon. This movie also features one of the worst battle sequences using swords, starting from the very first one on the bridge. Probably because the average shot duration is 0.2 seconds and you have no idea whose doing who as blood is shed. For tutoring on how a bloody good sword battle is filmed Mr. B. needs to see Braveheart a few times. He even uses this lightning-speed editing during character shape-shifting for heaven's sake! Who told him this is a good artistic tool?<br /><br />Does it have any saving grace? Not really, but two things do standout. One is the dynamic subtitles that shape shift and change depending on the mood, narrator, noise level and scene content. Pretty neat. The other is a single shot that was deliberate and well executed. It is a tracking shot that follows a screw as it comes loose from an airplane and falls, falls all the way down to its final destination in a woman's coffee cup in a building under the aforementioned vortex. Even this shot does not serve any purpose but itself. It is cool, but nothing more than an extra. Night Watch would've made a tighter and more enjoyable film in the hands of a better director and script writer. As it is, it's a waste of time and money.\n",
      "One of the least interesting in the James Bond series, Moonraker is big and dumb and bears no resemblance to the superb thriller penned by Ian Fleming. This is the movie where Bond goes into space to prevent madman Hugo Drax from destroying human kind with the poison from orchids (in the novel Drax only wanted to destroy London with a rocket). Idiocy is rife throughout, from Drax's comical henchmen notably Jaws (who was menacing in The Spy Who Loved Me) to Space shuttles that blast off at a moments notice as though it's as easy as taking off in a Cessna. There's also Drax's space station that is invisible from radar (yes, but optical telescopes and the naked eye don't require radar). The increasing globe trotting nature of the nutty Q (Desmond Llewellyn) is quite absurd also, remember way back in the early Bond's when he was just a common functionary in the bowels of the secret service building. The best scenes are the free fall moments from a plane in the pre-title sequence, Bond's spin (literally) in a centrifuge machine and the death of Hugo Drax's secretary (who Bond has bedded) at the hands of some vicious mastiffs - a scene that is a bit jarring amongst the rest of the campy and less serious than usual action scenes. Those that enjoy the zany and campy such as the 60's Batman and Dean Martin's Matt Helm movies may love this but the Bond character (and the situations)are too far removed from Fleming's version for any satisfaction.\n",
      "Why did anyone involved with this wonderful franchise allow this trite to be filmed? Why couldn't someone with a conscience have burned the final print before it was released? Why did they allow Roger Moore to continue playing Bond when he was over 50??<br /><br />If you haven't gotten the picture yet, this is, by far, the absolute worst of the series. There are a few decent scenes, but, let's face it, the whole space station battle thing was idiotic. Then, there's Jaws. He went from a terrifying villain to a comedic sidekick. The acting is horrendous on all fronts, the story is horrible (read the book by Fleming, which has a much more insidious, believable plot), and, unfortunately, it's the last one Bernard Lee (M) is in. DON'T SEE THIS MOVIE.\n",
      "This has to be the most ridiculous James Bond movie i have ever seen. The thing that made it so revolting was the scenes with Jaws and finding that girl and the premise that he goes from trying to kill Bond and then becomes his friend was so bad. And stealing a space shuttle gave the impression that the producers wanted to give a futuristic spin on the series and it flopped big time. Thank God they got back on track with For Your Eyes Only. An excellent plot driven movie. I skipped seeing Moonraker for a long time cause i heard it was awful, i wished i never saw it because it was 10 times worse than i thought it would be! So take my advice, skip this movie at all costs and see For Your Eyes Only or Man With The Golden Gun instead.\n",
      "Anyone who thinks this is the best or even one of the best Bond films is in love with Roger Moore or didn't see the other 20 films. It may have been highly regarded when it came out, but compared to the others in the series it is quite weak. Michael Lonsdale had a lot of potential as Drax. Why does he have a English accent? He is German in the book! They could have at least got that right. I liked Jaws more as a murder machine in TSWLM. I do not like Bond in space at all. Lois Chiles is possibly the most boring Bond girl in the series, and such stiff acting! I put this one lower than the Man With The Golden Gun (Christopher Lee was ten times better as a villain than Lonsdale). In the bottom 5 in the series (not the worst mind you, that belongs to Die Another Day or A View To A Kill). This movie may have been quite good if they had stayed close to the book. I doubt Moore could have played Bond though if that happened.\n",
      "The first law of storytelling says that you need a conflict in order to have a story. The question in this film is whether there is enough conflict to maintain sufficient interest through a feature-length production. The film never goes much beyond the basic premise - kids trek into the wild, kids get lost in the wilds, one gets injured. There is more drama and intrigue to the average Readers Digest real-life crisis feature than there is on display here.<br /><br />The scenery is easily the star of the show, and is not always shown to best effect. The scenes of interaction with dangerous animals are badly handled, and the result is strictly a by-the-numbers job. Unless you particularly like one of the actors or simply must see every film in this genre, there isn't much to recommend this.\n",
      "wow. I have to say that this movie was the biggest let down in my life. after hearing on websites that this movie was gritty and gory and all this other good stuff, I went to check it out at the rental store. after seeing 2 minutes of this episode I was utterly utterly disappointed and ashamed. the English dub sounds like a cheap 70's porno, the animation looks like a bunch of junior high kids got together some day and drew this crap up, keep in mind that this came out in 93, only 2 years before ghost in the shell. the story , oh my goodness! it makes no sense! from little gray people showing up out of nowhere and with no explanation to what they are, to babies coming out of statues, the only reason I saw the whole thing was hoping that some action scene would save this holy piece of bad anime crap. never ever ever watch urotsukidoji... do yourself a favor and go rent yourself Akira or Mononoke..please\n",
      "This movie was so bad, I can't explain it in words. The movie just shows a monster that rapes a woman and some nuclear bombs flying through the air. I hated the first Urotsukidoji, but this one really SUCKS!\n",
      "Was there something in the water in 1979? I was reading up recently about some of the films that major movie stars made in 1979 and it is remarkable how many actors were busy wasting their talents on duds in that year. Michael Caine in Beyond the Poseidon Adventure; Laurence Olivier in Dracula; Roger Moore in Escape to Athena; Jason Robards in Hurricane; Peter Cushing in A Touch of the Sun; Donald Sutherland in Bear Island; James Mason and Anthony Quinn in The Passage; Robert Shaw and Lee Marvin in Avalanche Express; and Richard Harris in A Game For Vultures. Even some directors seemed to be affected by the curse of 1979 - Steven Spielberg, for instance, made his only fully-fledged turkey in the shape of \"1941\". The '79 trend for big stars in bad films also extended to Sean Connery. Poor old Sean's 1979 film, Meteor, is a disaster movie of stupefying awfulness.<br /><br />It is revealed that a huge meteor is on collision course with earth, so big that unless it is diverted or destroyed its impact could cause another Ice Age. The American president (Henry Fonda) instructs professor Dr. Paul Bradley (Sean Connery) to figure out how to blast the meteor to bits by using secret nuclear weapons positioned in orbit above the earth. However, Dr. Bradley soon calculates that the American weapons alone will not halt the meteor. The Russians are brought in and informed of the potential destruction of the world as we know it and, in a race against time, the Americans try to persuade them to admit that they too have space-based nuclear missiles which could be added to the strike.<br /><br />The special effects are remarkably poor for a post Star Wars sci-fi film, but the film fails on many other levels too. None of the actors look enthusiastic about being here; Ronald Neame and Stanley Mann's script is full of idiotic dialogue and plot contrivances; excitement is persistently undermined by interminable talky scenes; and the characterisation is so ludicrous that it makes you want to grind your teeth with despair. Soon after this, disaster movies came to an end, not to be seen again until their special effects-enhanced re-emergence in the mid-1990s. When you see Meteor, you'll immediately understand why the genre self-destructed.\n",
      "You can tell what sort of movie this is by the way the music changes depending on whether we're looking at the (extremely phallic) American or Russian missiles; whether we're watching them changing aim, whether we're watching them launch, whether we're watching them run out of fuel, whether we're watching them approaching the asteroid or strike it in a cataclysmic 'strobe' effect or whether we're just watching them gleam in space. And the bi-national musical themes sort of merge when the missiles join up together. All the while there is helpful large lettering on the control centre monitors, telling you which missile-launching satellite is slowly going through its motions. There's also an unmistakable deep synthesiser fnaaaar-fnaaarp to indicate that we're watching the asteroid. Asteroid, mind you, not meteor. The meteor got killed in the first reel. So the missiles are the actual stars of this cross between Battlestar Galactica and Paint Drying: The Final Reckoning. The message must be that 'nuclear missiles are actually capable of doing a lot of good, given the right circumstances'. I suppose a lot of people, apart from the scriptwriter, worked really hard to get this film to the screen. It's unfortunate that the costume designer really did a number on Sean Connery, who doesn't let the impending end of the world interfere with his attempts to score with the (no disrespect to Miss Wood) somewhat mumsy Russian translator. Mind you, when you're locked up in those command centers underneath New York you tend to get a bit, er, undiscriminating. And Karl Malden keeps his Trilby hat on as long as he can. Other reviewers have pointed out the occasional sparkly bits in this terrible movie, but it's a shame the only enjoyment to be had is in picking it apart. I gave it a 'two' because I was thinking, 'if the asteroid is in space, it's weightless - so why do they need 20 hundred-megaton warheads to divert it?', and then in a flash I understood the theory of relativity. Darn! I hope I didn't spoil relativity for you!\n",
      "This is cheesier than a cheese-o-phile's toenails, and if it wasn't so darned boring in most scenes, would actually be almost entertaining. Unfortunately, ten minute plus scenes of overpaid actors watching 70s style monitors in silence does not make for riveting drama. And the uh 'special' effects? These resemble nothing more than a cohort of marital aids taped together and heading woozily space-ward. They uh, don't look very real - as the 'artist' hadn't twigged the concept of 'weathering' at that stage - making models look realistically aged and grimy. Still we do have the spectacle of Karl Malden having a severe hair malfunction during the 'money' shot when the Hudson river, or what looks like either (a) chocolate soup, or (b) sewage, engulfs the assembled anti-Meteorites. Helpfully, Sean Connery is on hand to help Karl sweep back that 'repartino' and dignity is restored. Great for those of us older folk who have trouble sleeping, I struggled to stay awake to watch this over the course of three evenings and felt greatly refreshed for weeks afterwards. Q - another hair featurette - isn't Martin Landau's hair a wee bit on the uh, longish side for a serving U.S. officer??\n",
      "Has a number of scenes that easily meet requirements to be spoofed by MST3K. Best example: Landau throws a child-like temper-tantrum in the control center, threatening not to come back until he has full control of the goings-on. Plus, a lot of the dialog is simplistic, cartoon-like, i.e. not very realistic at all. There are a number of fallacies and absurd situations: 1) Connery says the 5-mile meteor will have the power of 250,000,000 tons of TNT (or 250,000?); either way that would be an understatement. But okay; I'm nit-picking, 2) Less nit-pickingish is calling the potential impact (only!) ten times stronger than the strongest earthquake; it's more like a million times stronger, 3) It's impossible to redirect a meteor when it's only days away from impact (again, nit-picking, or maybe they didn't know that then - though I doubt that), 4) it isn't possible to destroy a meteor that big (and that fast) with a series of nuclear hits, 5) One of the space centers only discover a big one going towards NY when it's just minutes away from impact! What were they doing, sleeping? 6) And does it have to hit NY of all places? Why do these meteors and asteroids always aim for the well-known cities? 7) It should have been more devastating; they showed it's impact to be more like that of a huge earthquake than a meteor, 8) the absurdity that governments would actually think about politics when the future of the entire planet is at stake - and that they actually need convincing that warheads need to be used?! The film is also quite slow.\n",
      "The name Samuel Z Arkoff appears first on the credits. This could be interesting or it could be terrible. Keep watching. The cast includes Sean Connery, Natalie Wood, Brian Keith, Karl Malden, Martin Landau, Trevor Howard and Henry Fonda. Now there is a decent bunch of actors, all usually good value. Keep watching. Directed by Ronald Neame, a distinguished British director by any standards. And then follows a disaster of a disaster film.<br /><br />There is a strange dichotomy between the high quality of the cast and the low quality of the other elements in the film. The painfully meagre special effects, the shrill music, the leaden plot. It seems a strange brew and even a reviewer like myself who will always try to pick out some good points in a film am at a loss. The thing that distracted me the most was that the meteor itself, a wide lump of pitted and gruyered rock seemed to have a sound effect, like an engine! Perhaps it was my imagination.<br /><br />This film is not good enough or bad enough to be a cult film. It is just tepid and flat and makes 'the Towering Inferno' look like the 'Citizen Kane' of disaster movies.<br /><br />\n",
      "Well o.k.,o.k.,nobody in \"Meteor\" actually says that - after all,that would be downright plagiarism,but we do have a lot of \"hommages\",not to say rapine and pillage from thirty years of space movies,every one infinitely better than this travesty. The earth is threatened with destruction by a giant lump of rock,er,that's it really.The world doesn't end - obviously - so the element of suspense is totally absent,as is every other attribute required for an entertaining,involving movie. From the appalling gurning of Mr B.Keith to the hysteria of Mr M.Landau, the acting is embarrassing.Mr S.Connery treats his part with the contempt it deserves - which is considerable.Mr K.Malden is at his rabble - rousing worst and I will draw a veil over the performances of Miss N.Wood and Mr T.Howard,suffice it to say I doubt if they would want to be remembered for them. It is heavy on Cold War \"Irony\",i.e. the Russians and Americans having to pool their nuclear resources to ward off a threat from outside,a conceit that was hardly original twenty years earlier and which had become very threadbare by the end of the seventies. \"Meteor\"'s only virtue is in it's comparative brevity - hardly,you might think - sufficient to warrant a viewing.And you'd be right.\n",
      "Every stereo type is here. Russians are evil, Americans are wonderful, the rest of the world does not exist except as onlookers.<br /><br />Were we all really stupid enough to get on a bus, wait in line and go into a cinema to watch this? I noticed the special effects were made by people out of the Blue Peter school of special effects. A Boeing 707 lands with the Russians on board...The USSR at that time would NOT own Boeing aircraft, especially to transport their people around internationally.<br /><br />Awful film, skip it. A real shame so many BIG stars made this, I suppose the money was good.\n",
      "Even Sean Connery lowered himself to appear in a 70's disaster film, and it was a really bad one too. The effects were terrible, laughingly bad even for 1979. This film was so bad even Sean's wig refused to appear. As I watched it I have expected Roger Moore's 007 to blow up the Meteor on the Space Shuttle he had in Moonraker, to put the real James Bond 007 (Sean) out of his movie misery. Luckily Sean would bounce back in the likes of The Name of the Rose, The Untouchables, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, The Rock etc. The Meteor must be his worst film by far.\n",
      "I have to admit, I love 70's disaster movies. They wallow in so much camp,cheese and sheer tackiness that they're fun. . But Meteor isn't really campy or entertaining. It's really pretty boring. The special effects are laughable. No literally, I laughed up strawberry yogurt all over my boyfriend's couch at the sight of the meteor. Or make that old bread or rock or what ever that was. The great cast give apathetic performances. \"Why am I here\" seem to be going through their heads. Not that I blame these great actors one moment. Martin Landau's over acting is pain full to watch. The climax is not exciting. There just seems to be no suspense built up in the movie. Over all, not a bad movie. But just a very boring one.\n",
      "Disgruntled former scientist with NASA is brought back to the fold after a comet--\"wrenched out of orbit by Jupiter's gravitational pull!\"--collides with an asteroid in space, sending a chunk of rock five miles wide heading straight for Earth. Disaster flick from American International looks fairly convincing, if you're not too demanding. The heated exchanges between the scientists and the generals is wearing, but at least the sub-plot regarding the stubborn Russians gives us tongue-in-cheek Brian Keith as an astrophysicist and Natalie Wood as his assistant and translator, both speaking perfect Russian! The dialogue is almost as overwrought as Laurence Rosenthal's score, which would be entertainingly cheesy were it not so repetitive and intrusive. Directed by Ronald Neame, he of \"The Poseidon Adventure\", and an apparent victim of director-typecasting. The scientific rhetoric leaves itself open for logical criticism, and when the smaller meteorites hit Asia and the Alps, we are treated to some very tacky archival and stock footage. Pretty depressing overall, with Sean Connery looking uneasy and Henry Fonda inserted here and there as the U.S. President. ** from ****\n",
      "I just stumbled over this gem on a very independent TV station & I'm still stunned. This dreadful classic must have driven them from the theaters in the 70s... and, like any good cheese, it's only gotten more pungent with age. It's amazing how many d-movie cliches they managed to pack into one film. There are so many deliciously squirm inducing moments. Among my favorites are Brian Keith as the surly Russian (evil commie with the heart of gold)... Martin Landau as the rabidly paranoid AirForce general - an over the top community theater version of Geo C Scott's Gen Turgedson in Strangelove... I guess my favorite is the \"star\" - the giant mcnugget that's hurtling toward earth. ...And all the special effects that undoubtedly inspired a generation of kids with super-8 cameras to think \"I can do better than that!\" To anyone who loves truly terrible cinema - this is a must see.\n",
      "This is a disaster movie from director Ronald Neame (The Poseidon Adventure), but the real disaster is just how much this film sucks. Basically a comet/asteroid/meteor (whatever you want to call it) is heading for a collision for Earth, and obviously it could extinguish mankind if it hits. So the authorities want to combine the nuclear capabilities of both theirs and Russia's fire power to destroy the rock. People involved in the mission, in whatever way, are Dr. Paul Bradley (Sir Sean Connery), Tatiana Nikolaevna Donskaya (Natalie Wood), NASA's Harry Sherwood (Karl Malden), Dr. Alexei Dubov (Brian Keith) and Maj. Gen. Adlon (Martin Landau). Also starring Trevor Howard as Sir Michael Hughes, Richard Dysart as Secretary of Defense, Henry Fonda as the President and Roger Robinson as Hunter. What makes this film so awful is there is hardly any effort in the acting, well, they kept their faces straight. There's that ridiculous scene where everyone is getting covered in mud in the subway, and all the model rockets and the rock are not convincing enough, because you can tell their models, especially with the crappy explosions. Just one of the most terrible films I have ever seen. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Sound (it shouldn't have been nominated for any!). Very poor!\n",
      "It seems incredible that this codswallop was released 2 whole years after that definitive science-fantasy epic 'Star Wars'. Didn't these people watch that movie and see how high George Lucas had raised the bar for special-effects? With its sub-Gerry Anderson gadgets, its rousing 'Thunderbirds' style anthems, and its hokey un-special effects' this movie's production standards seem to hail from at least a decade earlier. Just check-out the falling bodies in the 1960's 'War Of The Worlds'; they're actually more believable.<br /><br />Scientists have discovered a large piece of rotating gingerbread, that bears a striking resemblance to Karl Malden's nose, on a collision course with planet Earth. It's a science fiction movie then? Well, not exactly. The reds are still under the beds so it's a cold war drama instead. That worthy old Russian diplomat Perry Stroyka has to do his stuff and make the anti-nose-defence-system a co-operative east-west effort. Is it a meteor? Or is it an asteroid? You decide; the scriptwriters evidently can't. Call it a nasalisk.<br /><br />In keeping with tradition, a host of top-dollar actors and actresses are bribed into compromising their careers. We see Henry Fonda, Natalie Woods, He Of The Proboscis, and of course: Sean Connery. Now there's a man with a sense of humour. Together they chew through a script with lines to die for - or at least from, probably by choking.<br /><br />To maintain its flagging interest, there are smaller noselets that arrive without warning at fairly regular intervals, unleashing some of the most lamentably wretched destruction scenes ever witnessed in a movie.<br /><br />Even as a bunch of Blue Peter washing-up bottles disguised as nuclear missiles are on their to the gingerbread, a noselet is inbound for New York, where the control centre has been sensibly sited underneath a river. Actually, that's not so absurd. Check-out Britain's 'National Archive' sited on the Thames flood-plain at Kew (you can bet that the most valuable items are stored in non-waterproof containers in the basement).<br /><br />So; just as the movie is about to climax with the destruction of the nasalisk, the camera cuts to Sean Connery and his team, now having to dig their way out of the smashed underground bunker. And - yes - the river does break through and - yes - it's a life and death race to the surface. This escape is cut and cut again with various boring views of rockets apparently whizzing through space. Will they stop the nose? Will Connery's team escape? Two climaxes for the price of one. Now that's good value. Lousy directing, but good value.<br /><br />Most of the rockets hit the nasalisk in three waves. The first two waves have the effect of causing a small part of it to glow red. Whereas the third wave blows it completely to atoms. Which is rather strange as each wave was supposed to have equal explosive intensity.<br /><br />Three or four of the rockets malfunction. And what becomes of them? Well; gravity would suggest that what goes up must come down. So there are several nukes destined to fall back to Earth, detonate in high atmosphere, and sprinkle everyone and everything with radioactive fall-out. Hmm.<br /><br />Yes, well; I think that's enough. Watch it with some friends and plenty of beer and your're likely in for a great laugh. But don't even pretend to take it seriously. I'm sure Mr Connery didn't.\n",
      "Some of the lousiest special effects imaginable are on display in this all-star dud about a meteor spiraling toward Earth. The US and Russia work in unison to try to stop it. The cast of acting giants in this dreck is mind boggling. Sean Connery is the lead and the supporting cast includes a particularly bad Natalie Wood as a Russian interpreter, Brian Keith as a Russian needing her services, Karl Malden, Martin Landau, and Henry Fonda (proving again his chronic need to appear in all the really BAD disaster movies of the 70s...ROLLERCOASTER, CITY ON FIRE, TENTACLES). The director, Ronald Neame, was responsible for the classic POSIEDON ADVENTURE, but lightning does NOT strike twice with this waste of time.\n",
      "Sorry, but am I the only one that really really hates this show? It's trash I did not like the voices and I think the girl's voice was the worst voice I'd ever find and this is the worst series I would ever search for. I really think the movie was much better, it was very delightful and amazingly magical but this one was the worst rip off of a movie. I would find something better than this disgusting demon spirited slob negative 999 and a million more I'll buy, once I see another one of this, I'ma get up and watch good movies like Cloudy with a chance of meatballs yuck! Newbies, please don't bother because Ariel's friends' magical spirits and her all of the characters are altered and changed because this is way too emo for me, look for something better.\n",
      "Not one of Edgar G. Ulmer's best, but I'm glad they saw fit to release this one on DVD. However, if you're looking for another little Ulmer classic like BLUEBEARD (1944) or DETOUR (1945), you'd better look somewhere else 'cause this ain't it.<br /><br />Gloria Talbott, the daughter of the late Dr. Jekyll, is slowly being hypnotized and pumped full of drugs into believing that she is the killer of a couple of women who were found near her late father's estate. She is slowly being driven mad by the real killer who wants her to take the blame for it.<br /><br />Of course she isn't the one because she's the heroine and we can't have the heroine turn out to be a bad guy. This is the 50s, after all. <br /><br />We also have John Agar as the Talbott's fiancée and Arthur Shields as the weirdo who is the executor of the late Dr. Jekyll's estate. They don't really add much of anything to all this beyond chewing up some film time. That is, until the very last 5 minutes of the film. <br /><br />But what's really a bummer is that the killer is revealed in the very first flashback of the film, so why Ulmer threw away the element of surprise is a real mystery. I guess you'll just have to see it for yourself.<br /><br />And considering the fact that Allied Artists didn't always use the best of film stock, the digital remastering looks as good as can be expected for a low budget film like this. No more excessively grainy prints to look at.<br /><br />I'll give it a 4 out of 10 for at least being worth a look, especially if you're into Ulmer's films like I sometimes am.\n",
      "This is a low-grade horror film which has been culted into a reputation beyond its worth because of its director's involvement. The plot is strikingly similar to that of another notorious potboiler - SHE-WOLF OF London (1946) - but, at least, here the monster is seen (albeit ineffectively made-up): despite the titular reference, the script pays little to no credit to previous cinematic incarnations of the R.L. Stevenson novella - opting, instead, to indiscriminately incorporate elements of lycanthropy and vampirism which make no sense at all...but which lend the film value as a unique curio and one which, in view of its sheer audacity, it is difficult to hate (indeed, the whole misguided enterprise reminded me of the contemporaneous FRANKENSTEIN 1970 [1958])! <br /><br />Despite the ultra-cheap production, the film makes the most of its foggy atmosphere and the hallucination sequences are effective in a naïve sort of way. Casting is below-par but, at least, Arthur Shields (who also appears in a silly book-end in full monster make-up - but, then, as Gloria Talbott's legal guardian spends the rest of the film trying to convince her that she is the werewolf!!) and John Dierkes (as a particularly vehement believer in the Jekyll 'legend' despite being in their employ - or, so it seems, since he's always hovering about the estate!) enter gleefully into the spirit of the thing.<br /><br />I had been toying with the idea of purchasing the All Day DVD of this one ever since it was released; I'm glad I managed to catch up with it eventually without having to purchase the disc - being shown on late-night Italian TV, as part of a Jekyll & Hyde marathon which included snippets from a variety of films based on the venerable tale (I was especially gratified by the inclusion of a couple of scenes from Jean Renoir's THE TESTAMENT OF DR. CORDELIER [1959], which I've been yearning to see forever, and also ABBOTT & COSTELLO MEET DR. JEKYLL & MR. HYDE [1953], which I haven't watched in ages - I really ought to get down to purchasing either the R1 or R2 DVD releases of the films featuring the comic duo!)...\n",
      "I've read plenty about director Ulmer being some poverty-row genius but this flick is only 70 minutes long and is still boring. Mixing the Jekyll monster with werewolves may sound like a fun idea but the treatment here leaves much to be desired. The new widescreen DVD of this movie looks real soft throughout much of the movie which might be a fault of the original movie or just a bad transfer.\n",
      "I love the first SLUMBER PARTY MASSACRE partially for nostalgia value but mostly because it's a genuinely fun movie, so I figured I'd give a go at this one, ignoring warnings such as the 4 Star Joe Bob review on the front of the video box. I watched it with several friends, and I'll tell you what, we never had such a good time making fun of a brain-dead exploitation movie before. This one really does reach new depths of stupidity, and for that reason alone I adore it!<br /><br />The plot is basically summed up in the title - Jackie (Keely Christian, whoever she is) throws one last sleepover party for her giggly high-school friends (who look no younger than 25), some dumb guys sneak over and try to scare them and a psycho killer shows up with his portable electric drill and starts laying into these idiots. Apparently the ladies in the house don't know how to open a door or window to escape, which becomes almost a running gag after awhile. They also hilariously fail to subdue the killer despite being given half a dozen chances to do some serious damage. The list of possible suspects is pretty ridiculous, especially the peeping tom next-door-neighbor, who spies on the girls dancing topless with his telescope, and \"The Weirdo,\" a mute voyeuristic albino who earlier in the day was caught staring at the girls during their beach volleyball game.<br /><br />There's one moment of sheer hilarity when the psycho surprises a guy at the door with his large, high-powered drill, sending a half-dozen lingerie-clad babes shuffling back and forth in front of the camera in a panic. Another highlight is Maria Ford's gratuitous bare-ass shot as she tries to escape up through the basement window but keeps falling. And we've all seen the standard electrocuted-in-bathtub death scene countless times before, scene, though instead of the usual hair dryer or radio being tossed in the tub, this time it's caused by a vibrator that one character plugs in and leaves sitting on the sink while she's taking a bath. A guy who gets his feet cut off with a chainsaw manages to crawl all the way back across town to the house in a matter of minutes. The acting (aside from the guy who plays the killer, who's awful) really isn't too bad for this type of film, some of the songs on the soundtrack are pretty good and if you like your movies trashy, bloody and silly, you'll find a lot to enjoy here. For sheer entertainment it gets a 7 out of 10 but playing by the rules of movie reviewing (i.e. quality), it's about a 3. I'll go ahead and give it a 4.\n",
      "Warning, some potential spoilers await.<br /><br />Really, how many hits does it take to knock someone silly or knock them out?<br /><br />The inane female characters in this film hit the main villain not one, not two, not three, but four separate times (that I could count) in the head, then would leave the area to have him recover and go on his killing spree again within a matter of seconds.<br /><br />I recognize that horror films are thin on plot, but this one is so thin on plot there is absolutely no motive as to why the killer does what he does besides his uncle who was a cop and died? Is that reason enough to go on a rampage killing a bevy of teenage kids? Obviously the writers and director thought so. Oh yeah watch out for the sly stereotypes as well, like the stupid policeman that is Irish, OH THE HILARITY!\n",
      "This is still a pretty bad and silly simplistic typical slasher but when being compared to the previous sequel \"Slumber Party Massacre II\" this movie is a step up from that one.<br /><br />What is mostly silly in the Slumber Party Massacre movies is that it features always a different driller-killer but things just never get explained why and how. Yes, this movie does provide a bit of an explanation but its not a particular good or credible one. It's the foremost reason why the Slumber Party Massacre movies are pretty simplistic in their form and concept. The only thing the movies are somewhat original in is that it features girls in the main roles and the movie is somewhat of an horror-chick-flick.<br /><br />The first killing occurs pretty fast into the movie, just as was the case with the original, which keeps things going pretty fast from the start on and doesn't make the movie drag as much and be such a total bore as \"Slumber Party Massacre II\". As a matter of fact this movie is just very similar to the first movie. Very similar indeed. It perhaps seems more like a remake, or update with more nudity, than an actual sequel. So don't expect this movie to be a terribly original one.<br /><br />The gore compensates a lot however. The previous Slumber Party Massacre movies weren't that really gory but this movie knows to throw in a couple of good gory sequences. Nothing the genre fan couldn't handle but it's all good enough.<br /><br />The story gets basically thrown overboard when the killer makes his entrance to the party. It makes it a pretty dumb movie to watch but it of course is all mostly consistent with other genre examples. The story just isn't the foremost important thing in a teenage-slasher flick.<br /><br />As you would expect, the acting also really isn't much special and the characters all remain terribly flat but it sort of all adds to the camp and status of the entire movie.<br /><br />Oh well, it's all watchable enough for the true fans of the genre and for the people who gave up watching Slumber Party Massacre movies-series after the previous sequel, give this movie a change, you might up liking this movie. For people who just want to see a good slasher-flick, just skip this one.<br /><br />4/10\n",
      "I haven't seen the second one, nor do I plan to since I watched the trailer for it since it was in the \"Extras\" section for SPM 1. I figured this one would have been good since it seemed that'd it be much like the first one. Not only that, they tried to add some storyline to it, which would have been nice if it was done correctly.<br /><br />The acting is decent compared to other horror slashers, though it was pretty bad in some parts. There is some nice gore as well, which is always a plus. I can't say much here about the movie without spoiling it, but expect A lot of lampshades getting smashed over a psychopaths head and a lot of women running from window to window in an attempt to escape.<br /><br />I would only watch this movie with friends for laughs, other then that avoid at all costs.<br /><br />Dumbest line: \"No! You can't kill someone that's just lying there.\" Why not? He seemed to have a good time doing it to your friends...\n",
      "There's no escaping it: \"Slumber Party Massacre 3\" is terrible. The acting is so bad that you'll cringe, and the undercurrent of this film is more serious that the second one that had to be respected for charting its own course. How odd is this film? Well let's put it this way: the film bills one guy \"wierdo,\" however very clearly there are two of those.<br /><br />Okay, so the plot: some friends decide to have a Slumber Party, and only one girl gets to invite a guy. The other guys crash the party, and of course as happens, one by one the girls and their boyfriends are whittled down.<br /><br />For some reason, the killer dons a mask to kill the first couple, but then shuns it to kill most. Of course, there's no connection to the first two- why the killer chooses to use a drill when a knife, a machete, a gun, or any number of other things would make more sense. I guess however if the killer isn't using a drill, it can't be a \"Slumber Party Massacre\" film.<br /><br />On a related note, the quality of acting is so obviously varied- two or three of the actors are decent, and the rest are strictly chosen based on their cute-ness! I'd tell you more about the film, but I can't. It follows no logical projection or anything. Its total cheese, although its not meaning to be.\n",
      "Slumber Party Massacre III starts on a beach where Jackie Cassidy (Keely Christian) tells her friends that her parents are away & that they should come over to her place & have a slumber party. Sarah (Devon Jenkin) is given the task of getting in the food but as she gets in her car she is brutally murdered... That night all the girls meet up, drink, laugh & strip in front of each other as three guys turn up. However someone else much more unwelcome decides to gatecrash the party, a brutal killer is at large & intends to slaughter them all before the night is over...<br /><br />Directed by Sally Mattison (at least we now know a woman can make a horror film just as badly as any bloke) I thought Slumber Party Massacre III (although the version I watched had the title A Stab in the Dark) was a dull, predictable, unoriginal teen slasher that does nothing to try & distinguish itself in an already over populated & limited sub-genre. The script by Catherine Cyran is drawn out, it has the usual cardboard character's that could have come straight out of any other slasher film, it has no reasonable explanation behind the killers motives, it gives the killer identity away far too early & then it's just a boring precession until the end & to add insult to injury it has a fairly low body count. There is nothing in Slumber Party Massacre III that any horror fan wouldn't have already seen a 100 time before in just about any other slasher. The film takes itself far too seriously, it's incredibly dull & very slow at times.<br /><br />Director Mattison doesn't do a thing to try & liven things up, it's very flatly shot, it's utterly forgettable & throughly dull. There's no atmosphere & I just kept thinking to myself simply leave the house, run away, go to a neighbour's, call someone but just do SOMETHING instead of just standing there waiting to be killed. There's a decent kill at the start where someone has a drill shoved through their body but apart from that there's not much gore here, there's a few more drill murders, someone is impaled on a 'For Sale' house sign & in the films best kill someone is taking a bath & the killer drops a vibrating dildo in the water to electrocute her, death by dildo! There's a bit of nudity & sex as well but it doesn't really help that much.<br /><br />Slumber Party Massacre III is fairly well made, special effects are OK & it's quite well lit but it's all rather bland. The acting was poor throughout, don't give up your day jobs girls...<br /><br />Slumber Party Massacre III is nothing to get excited about, frankly I was pretty bored & felt liked I'd seen it all before. Much worse than either the original The Slumber Party Massacre (1982) or it's sequel the rather impressive & fun Slumber Party Massacre II (1987) so watch one of those instead.\n",
      "This was bad, even by slasher movie standards. The only reason it got a 2 instead of a 1 was the nudity. The acting was right on target for the genre though--reeeeeally bad. The chick that played Maria was terrible, but she did have a smokin little body. I tend to overlook bad acting in that case. Anyway, this one's good for a gag gift (which is how I got it)--thanks for reading.\n",
      "Teenage girls decide to have a slumber party which is interrupted(..to put it mildly)by a deranged madman whose mania derives from his sexual abuse as a child at the hands of his uncle.<br /><br />Third film in the series shows how tired the formula has become. Nothing at all fresh or original, even the killer's weapon of choice(..the cordless power drill)has become passé. The girls(..including bombshell Maria Ford)are all eye candy in their sleepover clothes, even if the actresses portraying them are unable to transcend their one-note characters. Basically, the film shows some of the girls having a beach hangout with their male friends from school. Juliette(Lulu Wilson)is enamored with a handsome blond, Kenny(Brittain Frye, in a dreadful performance)inviting him to the slumber party later that night..major catastrophic decision. The film presents two red herrings, a strange next door neighbor(Michael Harris) to Diane(Brandi Burkett), the one holding the slumber party, and an oddball staring at them at the beach(Yan Birch). I think no one will be fooled because it's just too obvious.<br /><br />But, the problem I have with this film(..despite the frustratingly questionable acts by the girls when up against the psychopath who locks them inside the house)is that the menace isn't the least bit convincing thanks in part to the performance of Frye. And, this guy is hit over the head by two lamps and a glass dish, is stabbed through the leg with a fireplace poker, with his eyes doused with floor cleaner, yet the girls still can not subdue him! There's one sequence which infuriated me..three girls, after the killer's eyes have been blinded, watch one of their own get her shirt ripped off and drilled to death without even attempting to help her! And, even when they do subdue him, the girls allow him to get free! You just want to pick up a heavy stone and clunk them over the heads! Anyway, the girls' boys are unable to stop him either, which makes this film hard to swallow because the killer isn't very imposing, except for his drill. The strength in numbers, even after they discover he's the wacko, fail to join forces to surround and cease him. They just disperse in all directions, with chaos as a result, the killer allowed to hunt each down, the drill doing some serious damage. Besides the drill boring through victims, there's little else that potent in the ultra-violence department. The murders are sadistic(..one victim's Achilles heel is sawed into with a chainsaw, another is stabbed in the chest by a \"For Sale\" sign post), but die-hard slasher fans have seen much worse. Maria Ford and Lulu Wilson shows us some flesh, so that's nice(..although Ford's mistreatment at the hands of the killer is pretty harsh). The motive for the killer to randomly kill women(..and the men who get in his way)is rather limp.\n",
      "A whole bunch of girls have a big slumber party. They dare the driller killer to show up. Guess what? He does. <br /><br />A very slow and boring film. Even the nudity or death scene by vibrator can't liven things up. By far and away the worse in The Slumber Party Massacre series. Avoid it at all cost. My rating: 2 out of 10.\n",
      "Well, where to start? I want to start off by saying that this movie was pretty bad, but the gratuitous nudity was comforting. This movie runs about 87 minutes, which is amazing considering the plot.<br /><br />First of all, how teenage girls get trapped in two story house with a basement and a garage is beyond me. Time and time again these girls absolutely refuse to leave the house even though there is a driller killer on the loose and they are \"afraid\" for their lives. Makes no sense. Of course, if they just walked out the back door or the front, they could just leave. I guess that makes too much sense. I guess I'm the idiot.<br /><br />The acting was abysmal. The killer was ridiculous and his reasoning to start killing was just laughable. The connection between why he was killing these girls and how his crazy uncle committed suicide and how he was picked on by these girls is just dumb. I have to admit some of the killers bad acting and corny lines were funny. Perhaps if I was in a more tolerant, comedic mood, I could laugh at this junk and give 7 out of 10. But I wasn't.<br /><br />Positives about the film...some good kills. Just to name a few: electrocution by way of dildo, stabbing with real estate sign, and drill to the gut. The special effects were good enough to get the point across. There was one part where the killer was drilling a victim and it was clear that the drill was not touching the stomach. The close up shot revealed a 2 to 3 inch gap between the drill bit and the victim's stomach. Apparently there wasn't enough budget to edit this part out. I understand why. No one put any time and effort in to this movie from beginning to end. And it shows.<br /><br />So with that said, the movie sorely lacks in every area imaginable, except for nudity. There was enough there to pass the short time the movie actually played. There was very little redemption about this one. The movie epitomizes the over-saturation of low budget, slasher films of the 80's. It is the very reason why movies like these went direct to video and died. Too bad, because I'm fan of slasher films, just not this one.<br /><br />3 out of 10.\n",
      "Can't believe no one used that summery line yet. I'm hilarious. Anyway onto the skimpy plot. A teen and her friends have a 'bitchin' slumber party. When their boyfriends stop by it's fun fun fun. Well until a killer with a drill bit shows up to menace them. Not the best slasher film I've seen by a long shot, but it does have a certain appeal to undiscriminating b-grade horror fans, myself included. Just not enough to raise it above a slightly below average slasher film.It IS however better then the first film in the franchise.<br /><br />Eye Candy: Maria Ford reveals boobs, Lulu Wilson bares her chest and ass (Sadly this is the only movie she's been in) <br /><br />My Grade: C+\n",
      "Well i think that the summary pretty much summs it up. Here's why. The killer is annoying. He sings and dances and drills people with a guitar drill. And the guitar drill was the only good part. The acting was terrible. And the special effects weren't really great. I give it a big c-\n",
      "I just was dumb struck when I received \"It Happened at Nightmare Inn\" on DVD, it was packaged as a double feature with \"Legacy of Blood\". This IS NOT the theatrical version, it is in fact ONLY 67 minutes long!! The distribution company on this one is a bunch of liars and crooks, I do not believe in selling product that advertises something which is not true. The running time for both features is listed in total of 3 hours and 30 minutes. If \"It Happened at Nightmare Inn\" is only 67 minutes long, then that means that \"Legacy of Blood\" is close to 2 hours and 30 minutes (which in fact is not the case) Regardless, please do not waste your money or rental dollars on this version released under the title of a \"Blood Soaked Cinema\" release called \"Back to the Grave\" With the running time only being 67 minutes, then this must be the television version that played in a 90 minute time slot. It sucks!! There are scenes that just end, characters that just react to nothing, no blood, no anything! Entire scenes are missing and what is left is just talk! I can not even begin to mention how terrible the sound is on this, and they have the nerve to list Dolby 5.1 as an option..the sound is so terrible that I thought my speakers were going to burst! Can I say anything positive? No...the movie is unwatchable, the story is torn to pieces, it makes no sense, and PLEASE do not be suckered by this like I was.\n",
      "Una Vela Para el Diablo, or the rather more poetic if pointless A Candle for the Devil as it's more commonly known amongst English speaking audiences, is set in a small Spanish village where American tourist Laura Barkley (Judy Geeson who is in fact English) is trying to locate her missing sister May (Loli Tovar) who is a photographer. Laura tries the small guest-house where her sister was staying, it's run by two elderly sisters Marta (Aurora Bautista) & Veronica (Esperanza Roy) who claim that May left that morning but who in fact hide a terrible secret. As Laura investigates her sisters whereabouts she learns Martha & Veronica lied to her & when another young attractive tourist named Helen Miller (Lone Fleming) mysteriously disappears Laura is convinced all is not as it seems at the guest-house...<br /><br />This Spanish production was co-written & directed by Eugenio Martin & is a pretty lousy way to spend 85 minutes of your time. The script by Martin & Antonio Fos takes itself extremely seriously & is a bit patchy, character's come & go with little regard for flowing narrative, people's actions & motives are questionable to say the least, the dubbed dialogue is poor & I'm not really sure who this will please. For a start the body count is low, there's no mystery elements or interest in whodunit as that's made perfectly clear from the start, the exploitation levels are virtually zero & to try & spice things up a bit there are a few unpleasant sex scenes, I mean if your going to show a sex scene at least have a decent looking actress rather than a near old age pensioner. It seems that a short 68 odd minute version is more readily available than the 83 minute version I saw, personally I'd be glad that it runs for 15 minutes less as that's 15 minutes of your life you don't have to waste watching this poor excuse for a film. I also have to mention the ending which is one of the worst endings to a film I've ever seen, basically Laura is trapped in the house with the mad sisters & looks out the window as a angry mob of villagers approach & then it just finishes as if they ran out of film or someone forgot to include the last reel!<br /><br />Director Martin does OK, he captures a certain feel of the Spanish locations but I'm not sure what. There are a couple of sequences approaching horror but it's not scary, there's no tension & it lacks any suspense. If your looking for gore forget it, there's a couple of stabbings, an eyeball in a meal, a decapitated head & some blood splatter but generally speaking this is very tame stuff. Things fare better on the nudity front but the actors used aren't exactly model material, unusually there is full frontal male nudity although I only mention it because it is unusual & not because I'm gay or anything.<br /><br />This was obviously a pretty cheap production & it shows, it's quite well made for what it is I supposed & at least it was shot on film & on location so that also gives it a cinematic look. It's always difficult to comment on acting when people have been dubbed, here the English dubbing is pretty terrible although maybe Geeson spoke English on set.<br /><br />Una Vela Para el Diablo is a rubbishy piece of Euro crap that's not really sleazy or exploitative enough to satisfy me & I'm sure there will be many out there who feel the same. I wanted to like it but I didn't, disappointing.\n",
      "I like the actor they chose to play Bourdain, really I do, but Anthony Bourdain he is not. And that is what is wrong with this series. I read the book and was really excited to rent the series, but I should have known better. Someone in TV land decided that Anthony Bourdain is too abrasive, in your face and rude, so the show \"softens\" Tony and loses all the spirit. Yes, the real Anthony Bourdain is in your face and abrasive and is very much about How Things Really Are. That is the spirit in which Kitchen Confidential (the book) was written. So honest, in fact, that when she gets OLDER, I am going to make my 12-year-old aspiring Chef read it before she decides in fact to spend oodles of money on Culinary school. It is that very in your face honestt that is missing. Tony is nothing more than an alcoholic, excuse me, reformed-alcoholic boy scout. Yawn. Meanwhile the _real_ Anthony Bourdain has a hit show on the Travel Network doing what he does best, telling it like it is.\n",
      "If you're into stock trading and if you've read Nicholas Leeson, it might help you enjoy this movie. If you're not, you might need to view a couple of times before the story grows on you.<br /><br />I'm still not sure how I can summarize best the story for you: Ewan McGregor plays Nick Leeson, a stock trader for England's Fairbank is given a mission in New Delhi. He builds up a team with people who know nothing about stock trading and together they'll play with the Nikkei. As they're \"playing\", mistakes are made by Nick's team and he wants to cover them up by opening up an account called \"88888\". Soon, he'll start gambling with the bank's own money. Unfortunately, the losses grow bigger and bigger until the bank goes broke.<br /><br />Since there is no real action, and it's really told like a story and not like a movie, you really have to rely on the actors' skills to appreciate the movie.\n",
      "No question that this movie is made very well. Good acting by everyone, good environments, much realism (no surprise !), a little fun and craziness, a little romance and marriage, a little of this and that.<br /><br />And the movie tries its best to be entertaining. The romance of the marriage couple is portrayed in a very, very realistic way, for example, I think that was the best part of the movie. And if you know more about money than I, maybe you will understand what really happened there at the stock market - the movie tried to explain that, but it was too fast for me.<br /><br />But it's most of the time really boring as hell because you know what will be the end after five minutes of the movie. And it's sometimes even more boring because its made that perfect. And for people which know about the Neeson case, it will be even more boring, for they know the end before the movie even starts.<br /><br />In the sum, I don't think I can recommend this movie, sorry.\n",
      "Where to start.... Okay firstly, unless you've been in hibernation the last few years you'll know the name Nick Leeson. The film follows Leeson through his days as a futures trader for Barings Bank (the oldest merchant bank in England) and his transfer to South-east Asia, through to the eventual collapse of said bank and Leeson's imprisonment.<br /><br />I'm not quite sure why 'Rogue Trader' was even made, either it's pro-Leeson and sees him as a courageous boss protecting his incompetent employees (yeah, right!) or the film merely tries to explain this particular corner of history. On both counts 'Rogue Trader' is left severely lacking, although McGregor tries valiantly, portraying Leeson as anything other than a spoilt child would seem impossible.<br /><br />The rest of the cast cannot however even be accused of trying to breath some life into this tepid affair. Friel appears disinterested (a feeling I felt all too often) as do Leeson's superiors.<br /><br />As much as I would like to promote this film, with its distinctly English cast, I'm afraid it's a lost hope. If you want I imagine you could spend a few hours trying to find some hidden meaning that would make the whole experience worthwhile, but you probably won't and who could blame you.<br /><br />Stay away unless you want your opinion of Ewan McGregor tainted and your view of Anna Friel confirmed!\n",
      "This movie is about as exciting to watch as paint drying. Granted, it wasn't a complete loss, Ewan was nice to look at...and someone loaned it to me, so I was spared the expense of movie rental. There are worse movies and there are far better movies, but I honestly watched it because I'm in the process of watching Ewan McGregor movies because he has this presence that is so strong that you just have to watch his work because he draws you in, and you end up sitting there watching, totally mesmerized. Very commanding! Now, only if Rogue Trader were a strong enough movie to carry him....\n",
      "In bringing a true story to the screen, directors are always hampered by the inevitable lack of suspense.<br /><br />We all know the plot of Rogue Trader, working class whiz kid brings down venerable merchant bank, gets caught & goes to prison. Fair enough. But where the director totally failed in this film is to generate any dynamism or energy in what should have been a frenetic, fast paced account of the collapse of Barings Bank.<br /><br />Rogue Trader has about as much zing as soggy custard. It's so flat, I was crying out for some passion, and I don't mean the abysmal scenes of Ewan MacGregor and Anna Friel cavorting clumsily on a heap of bearer bonds.<br /><br />MacGregor is convincing as Leeson, but the rest of the cast are just laughable. Special mention goes to the appalling efforts of Tim McInnerny as Tony Hawes and Nigel Lindsay as Ron Baker, and the entire Asian cast who were exceptionally wooden.<br /><br />You always know a film is in trouble when a character explains the technicalities of the plot to another character solely for the audience's benefit. Witness MacGregor's embarrassing explanation of the \"five eights\" account to his colleague. And trying to teach the complicated nuances of futures trading to his wide-eyed staff in a Delifrance? Please!<br /><br />Rogue Trader had potential. Captivating real-life plot, strong lead actor. But the film is a stinker, awash with cliches and cardboard cut-out acting. What a shame. Ewan MacGregor, you can do better than this!\n",
      "This movie is slow and dull. The fact that you know how it ends makes it even worse: it seems like they're trying to build up the tension and let you think that maybe Nick'll see the error of his ways. But then you remember what really happened. The soundtrack made the movie even worse, if that's possible. Nothing exciting ever happens. I can't see any reason why anyone would ever want to watch this movie.\n",
      "I picked this up on DVD under the title \"Return of the Bastards\" (in Greek, with English subtitles). It is either a shockingly inept piece of trash, or a brilliant parody of trash movies in general. What to expect: overexposed photography, lame fight scenes, non-existent \"acting\" (it should really be called \"line-reading\", because it's nothing more than that), ludicrous sound effects, fake gore and a plot lifted wholesale from \"Marathon Man\" with Laurence Olivier and Dustin Hoffman!!! I'm not kidding - they even included the famous \"is it safe?\" scene! I give this film 0 stars because it is truly terrible in every possible category, but that doesn't mean it's not fun to watch. For maximum laughs, probably best seen with an audience.\n",
      "The dopey, deadpan character sculptured by Leslie Nielsen is back in a \"James Bond-esque\" comedy as agent WD 40. There are more gag misfires in this movie, than a parking lot full of dead batteries. However, he's such a likeable guy, you can make it over the hump.<br /><br />Unfortunately, with the exit of the mad geniuses (The Zucker Bros. & Jim Abrahms), there's little here in this script to wave the pom-poms about. It's all been done too many times before.<br /><br />Of honourable mention is a priceless, very quick cameo with Pat Morita, which is an absolute gem. There are other assorted scenarios that came off well, too. See it if you must on a rainy Sunday, but this is pretty old, borrowed and blue.\n",
      "I caught 'Spy Hard' on television the other night, and the film really took me back to the early 1990s. I noticed Weird Al right away from his part singing the theme song. 'Spy Hard's' purpose is to create a comical version of James Bond and similar spy-themed films. Some of the comedy is very funny, but some of it wears thin throughout the film. (You'll either enjoy the sense of humour, or you will hate it.) WD40 is a great name for the secret agent, and Mr. T even makes an appearance. There is also a lot of adult-themed humour. By the end of the film, I was ready for it to be finished. It's funny, but it's not brilliant, but I cannot complain because it did let me laugh. If you like Austin Powers, you will probably like this, even though it is not as popular. It will also take you right back to the early 1990s. Not a perfect film, it does have some good humour.\n",
      "This was the worst movie I have ever seen. Normally, I enjoy the humor of Leslie Nielsen found in the Naked Gun movies. But this one was so bland, I am ashamed at myself for watching it all the way through.\n",
      "When I heard the reviews and saw the trailers for this film I decided to skip the cinema and video showings and wait for it to hit TV. It was a wise decision because this is probably one of the worst comedies (and films) I have ever seen. I cannot honestly remember a single decent laugh from myself. I was happy enough with the Naked Gun films when they were first released. The series upon which they were based was hilarious at times. Even the recent Dracula spoof produced the occasional chuckle, but it seems to have gone all pear shaped for Leslie now. How about some original jokes for a change!<br /><br />It begs the question - is this what Americans find funny? Surely by reading the script potential backers would find out just how laughless it is.\n",
      "It's OK to laugh at these sort of 'simple, stupid', comedies every now and then, even if it has Leslie Nielsen in it. This movie has some great of these 'simple, stupid' laughs in it but the story really restrains this movie from being a true good or recommendable one.<br /><br />The story is so bad that the movie becomes real painful to watch in parts! At times you really don't know what is really happening on screen or why, just because it doesn't make sense. It really lacked a real clear and good main plot-line.<br /><br />The movie also tries to spoof way too many movies, just for the sake of spoofing. Most of the time these spoofing moments really don't fit within the movie and seem to be put in completely randomly. It was as if the director was making a sport out of it how many movies he could spoof within one movie.<br /><br />It's of course also a very easy thing to spoof the spy-genre. In that regard this movie has all the jokes in it you would most likely expect.<br /><br />Of course most comical moments and dialog are very lame. But often they are so lame and stupid that you can't help but laugh at them. So no matter how bad this movie actually is, it's still a movie that can and most likely will make you laugh, with also some cameo's from people such as non other then Ray Charles and Hulk Hogan.<br /><br />4/10\n",
      "this movie is billed as a spoof/comedy,but it's not really funny.there are 1 or 2 mildly amusing moments,but mostly it's just silly,without being funny.this movie would work as an actual spy movie,except that you have the expectation that you will laugh.it's gonna be hard to get the required 10 lines of text in here,but i'll try.i think the problem is the filmmakers tried too hard to get laughs.sometimes you can go too far with a joke and it ends up as flat as a pancake.so the movie isn't really funny,but it does have 1 redeeming feature.that is the casting of Andy Griffith(TV's Matlock and the Andy Griffith show) as a maniacal nut case who plans to either destroy the world or rule it.Griffith is great in this movie.he has so much fun in the role.Barry Bostwick is also good for some comic relief.but overall,the movie is not good.the most i can squeeze out for \"Spy Hard\" is a 4/10\n",
      "I had to give this film a star rating. I wish I could give it none.<br /><br />It was so painful to watch. I bought it on DVD since I last saw it when I was a kid and I thought that it could make me laugh. Oh how wrong I was...It was a waste of £4...Which I could have bought a much better movie for.<br /><br />Leslie Nielsen is the only good part about this, oh and Griffith. Nielsen hasn't been in any descent stuff recently though. I want that to change though since hes outstanding and very underrated. Lets hope someone realises this before he ends up like Lloyd Bridges...He too was a great actor who was reduced to being letter-boxed as a slapstick comedian-actor.<br /><br />I strongly urge against buying this unless you have a defect which allows you to enjoy such trash.\n",
      "Leslie will never be as funny as he was years ago,it would take a miracle,the reason being he is accepting all these ridiculous scripts,just because hes in it doesnt mean it will change anything.Spy Hard has a very few funny scenes,and i find this film very similar to Nielsons other unfunny films like \"DRACULA DEAD & LOVING IT\" & \"WRONGFULLY ACCUSED\".I always wished their would be another Naked Gun,that is the only way Nielson can get his spoof fame back,now he is the same as any other star like Charlie Sheen in a spoof movie. Spy Hard wasnt funny,a very few scenes will make you laugh,i also recommend you avoid this.<br /><br />OVERALL FOR SPYHARD: 4/10<br /><br />GOOD POINTS OF FILM: First Spy Spoof<br /><br />BAD POINTS OF FILM: Terrible Script/Unfunny.\n",
      "This is one of those films i wish i had never seen. I actually spent perfectly good money to see it. I must have been out of my freaking mind. This movie is a disgrace. What was the director thinking? 'Let's just forget about good taste? Screw the story?' What a ripoff.\n",
      "Spy hard has its moments, especially the Weird Al song in the beginning and the parody of Home Alone. But still the movie is quite unfunny. Leslie Nielsen is again type-casted in this movie and it is too much like the Naked Gun movies. I would give this ** stars out of ***** (4 out of 10).\n",
      "Weird Al was funny as usual in the intro, but that was where the laughs ended. This movie tries to recapture the humor of Airplane and The Naked Gun, but fails miserably. It seems clear that the people who put this movie together did not even understand this type of humor.<br /><br /> In Airplane, the humor lies in taking logical steps from peculiar interpretations of events. \"Surely your joking\" \"I'm serious, and don't call me Shirley.\" Now that's funny.<br /><br /> This movie, however, merely has gags without context.\n",
      "Agent Dick Steele (Leslie Nielsen) must partner up with Agent Veronique Ukrinsky (Nicollette Sheridan) to stop General Rancor (Andy Griffith) from destroying the world with a nuclear missile hidden in his secret base. <br /><br />So, apart from that, I thought this movie was going to be a funny one. It wasn't, except for Weird Al Yankovic singing the opening theme song, which was quite entertaining. The rest of the film just tries way too hard to be funny which makes the film look really silly, like Police Academy for example (except that had more funny moments but there weren't many). Anyway, to sum this review up, all I can say is just don't bother watching this movie.\n",
      "I really hate this film, which is something I have never said about any other movie. I was ready to walk out on this film within the first 5 minutes. The only reason I didn't was because I had already handed over my hard earned money to see it. The story was complete rubbish, a mix of tired and unfunny spoofs of other films. Poor acting and casting decisions as well as some really bad jokes. If any film was going to kill off the spoof genre, this was going to be it. It is a great shame, because Leslie Nielsen has made some great films, none better that Flying High(Airplane) and The Naked Gun. There are no redeeming features in this movie at all so if you see it on a shelf in a video store, do yourself a favour and keep walking.\n",
      "Don't get me wrong. I am a huge fan of \"Police Squad! (In Color)\". It's just that what made that great is exactly what is missing from this movie. In the Police Squad! series, Leslie Nielsen played a straight dead-pan character, very serious. Very little mugging to the camera, and reacted to the silliness around him with a dryness that only Jack Webb could muster.<br /><br />In Spy Hard, we have a cartoonish character whose a buffoon. He mugs to the camera at every turn. He's trying to have fun with the audience. Sadly it just makes him look sad. The best thing about this movie (the 5 star moment) was the opening credits sung by Wierd Al. After that, to say it's ok is pushing it. It's bad, but not bad enough to be good. It's more like a poor-man's \"3 stooges\" style slapstick than anything, and I do mean totally destitute type of poor.<br /><br />You would be better off seeing Airplane or Police Squad! (and the Naked Gun movies that followed) 20 times in a row. You will find the 20th showing of any of these movies more enjoyable than the first viewing of Spy Hard.\n",
      "The credits sequence with \"Weird Al\" Yankovic is the only bit worth watching. Save yourself the Blockbuster night and just watch it on his DVD video collection and pass on this movie. A tired collection of fart jokes and name puns pass for wit in this alleged comedy. Dick Steele, Agent WD-40? Puh-leeze. The able cast is also hampered by terrible pacing and what looks like last-minute editing and over-dubbing to avoid a lawsuit by General Motors. (And you had wondered why General Mortars was the only non-pun name in the bunch.) I'm betting Andy Griffith doesn't have this one on his resume'. If you want to see a quality Bond/spy spoof, try the Derek Flynt movies with James Coburn or even the first Austin Powers flick. No matter how hard it begs, do not pull this movie's finger.\n",
      "The movie is pretty funny but it feels to much like Naked Gun, and especialy when Leslie himself is in it.<br /><br />The story didn't feel much worked out and fell like old jokes in it.<br /><br />3 out of 10\n",
      "This was one of those films for which I used Blockbuster's \"If you don't like it, we'll give you a free rental\" policy. This film was no more than a very bad attempt to clone the success of films like Naked Gun 1 and 2 (which btw are very good). Unfortunately this film failed miserably. I gave it a 2 out of 10...<br /><br />If you have not seen Naked Gun 1 or 2 than I recommend those instead...if you have, then there is no point of seeing this one.\n",
      "\"Spy hard\" moves in the well-known \"Nielsen-comedy-style\"(if such thing exists).It is a parody of well known movies.And some of them are good.So far,so good.However such a movie must have something more than this:the parody-scenes should be connected some way to each other or else the movie is nothing but a collage of scenes.And \"Spy Hard\" belongs in this category.<br /><br />Rating: 2 / 10. (* out of ****).\n",
      "This is one of the worst supposed 'comedies' that I have ever seen. There is not a single laugh in this movie and it is proof positive that Leslie Nielson cannot make a decent movie unless it has \"Airplane!\" or \"Naked Gun\" attached to it (and that's being quite generous to \"Naked Gun 331/3\") Whoever approved this script should never work again. Just imagine what damage they could do in other areas of the public sector!<br /><br />Seriously, tooth extraction is enjoyable compared to this. Avoid with every fibre of your being.<br /><br />\n",
      "SPY HARD starts with an in joke of having Mr T pilot a helicopter and that`s about as sophisticated as the film gets . It`s a spy spoof with refferances to IN THE LINE OF FIRE , SPEED , PULP FICTION etc and even includes a sly nod to FELLOWSHIP OF THE THE RING years before that movie was filmed ! . Leslie Nielson does his Frank Drebin routine under the surrogate name of Dick Steel . It`s entertaining enough but does get very silly in places and never gets close to the hilarity of THE NAKED GUN series\n",
      "After seeing this film I have to revise my understanding of the word 'comedy'. A good warning sign is any film that describes itself as 'quirky' or 'dark' and sure enough, Paradise Grove is neither of these. It assumes that to make a film jewish only requires that a character has to say schmuck and schwartzer a few times.<br /><br />Paradise Grove is totally devoid of anything resembling humour, the script sounds like it was made up ten minutes before shooting started and some plot devices look like they were bolted on from a completely different film. Some of the shots would make a first year film student proud. Rula Lenska shows talent by managing to pull off a passable appearance given the dire lack of material she is given to work with, but Ron Moody looks as though he only turned up to collect the pay cheque and Lee Blakemore as Kim makes Metal Mickey look like Lawrence Olivier.<br /><br />Ultimately this is probably one of the worst films I have had the agony to watch. By the end I almost felt embarrassed and was certainly intrigued as to how a film like this managed to get funded. Maybe it is an educational tool to show how not to make films.<br /><br />Do not expect to see at a cinema near you...ever!!!\n",
      "Poor Rula Lenska & Ron Moody how far they have fallen, to accept and perform in this clichéd dirge! Script, script, script I hear the gate keepers, the producers, the film council shouting, if the foremost essential key to a successful film, but know one obviously took the time read this one and kill this abomination at birth, in fact it would seem that unbelievably know one read it before taking part in this rubbish. Evidently everyone involved fees were high because the stench this one will leave behind will follow everyone who took part in this travesty of a drama to their graves. Take my advise and watch instead some early afternoon Australian soap reruns from the eighties, like 'Cellblock H' the performances are comparable the plausibility of the drama and dialogue vastly superior.\n",
      "This film was shown at this year's Sydney Film Festival as 'Half-Price'. I'm afraid I can't give a complete and proper review because I walked out on it after watching just over half of it. And I wasn't alone, as I noticed twenty or so other people leaving at the same time. I swear I heard the phrases \"rats leaving a sinking ship\" and \"women and children first\" in the foyer as people left. This is in fact the first time I've ever walked out on a movie, so that tells you something. I have no idea whether the film finds a way to justify itself in the end, but it had already used up all of my patience. I presume the director was trying to show us something about the lives of children when they're alone together by filming them up close, letting them do their own thing, and not including anything else that would intrude (such as a plot or dialogue). But from what I sat through, no matter what the pretentious intentions or justifications behind the film are, all that you're left with is the kind of boredom you'd get from watching someone else's particularly dull home movies of their kids. We're told very little about their lives, so we're left to watch their behaviour without any useful context. They listen to music, laugh, and go to the toilet. So what! Apart from the fact that the kids play together, we don't even get a feel for the bonds between them. This is really only bearable for a short while. By the 30-minute mark I was bored out of my skull. And when you're that bored, you start to question the point of watching scenes of kids sitting on the toilet, or hanging around the house naked while playing music. It's a lot like having someone show you pictures of their kids. If there are a couple of embarrassing photos in there - their kid naked in the bath or something - that's fine. But if it turns out that a whole heap of the photos are of their kids naked in the bath, then it can become plain weird and uncomfortable, and you start wondering why the person showing them to you doesn't realise it. It seems that I'm the first person to review this movie on IMDb. Hopefully someone who's sat through the whole thing will come along and write the second one, which might be more helpful than mine. But in the meantime, my advice would be to give this one a miss.\n",
      "The film is more \"wink-wink, nudge-nudge, instead of just plain funny. While it does have it's moments such as several points of \"the misbehavers\" including the end shot and the suddeness that ends \"the man from Hollywood\". But the rest seems to fall rather flat with poor production and muddled continuity. (a couple of the four \"acts\" play out at the same time and while at first glance seeing both sides of a phone call in different segments seems novel, you realize that the timing would not allow Ted the bellhop to be in two places at the same time.) Even the opening of Tarantino's Logo with Tim Roth's \"Mr. Orange\" unzipping to become \"Ted the Bellboy\" is funnier than most of the intended jokes. There are a lot of surprise cameos here, but that doesn't make the final product much better than an interesting diversion. Purely for fans of Tarantino and his gang.\n",
      "Okay, i'm a guy so i had to like all the toplessness in the first Room, the second room was quite annoying, 3rd room was humorous, gotta love the children, the little boy is from desperado. cute kids. The 4th room, well, its tarantino so its a 10. The only reason i got this movie was for Robert Rodrigous and Tarantino. Wasnt worth the 14 dollars though. I think Tim Roths character got annoying after the first 10 mins, obviously tarentino or rodrigous didnt pick the music for they're rooms, all in all, Dont waste your money, but if your a True Tarantino fan you must get it.\n",
      "Awful awful awful.... don't spedn the seemingly 8 hours it takes to watch this film. It can be funny in parts, but it really drags on, and has no pay off at the end. Stare at the wall or do something prodcutive instead of watching this poor effort.\n",
      "Weak, self-indulgent, misfiring at every step. I hope everyone had a good time making this mess, because the end result is not worth seeing.\n",
      "This is what happens when creative people think they can do anything and it will work. Its also what happens when \"hot\"celebrities are allowed to make a joke thats nothing but a self serving in joke.<br /><br />This is a bunch of stories, by different directors none of which is very good. Trying to figure out which segment is better is sort of like trying to figure out which pile of garbage is the best.<br /><br />If you've never heard of this film, I'm not surprised since the film was barely released to theaters. It almost never plays on TV, so unless you've sought it out, something I can't recommend, you've never seen it.<br /><br />Ultimately, other than for money the only reason I can think this was made was so that the directors would know that they never could make a worse film.<br /><br />3 out of 10\n",
      "The trailer certainly did its job attracting this viewer. I was not sure what type of movie I expected based on the trailer, but what I saw was nothing like what I thought I'd be seeing. The actual storyline was somewhat silly. The characters were by no means believable. I thought I liked Paul Giamatti, but his acting seems be the same as in the Cinderella Man. Bryce Dallas Howard is someone I cannot place, although she has been in a few big movies. She couldn't act her way out of a wet paper bag, much less out of a swimming pool. I have grown really tired of stereotypical Asian butchering of English. My wife is Chinese. Her second language is English. She doesn't sound like the Young-Sook Choi character. For that matter, few to none of the people I met and taught over my three years in China sounded like the Choi character. Overall, I thought the acting was fairly bad. I should have waited for it to come out on video.\n",
      "This movie was terribly done, although Paul Giamatti did well in his performance it was not enough to save this film. I watched this movie in a theater packed with other people all excited about this film, however after its showing, more than half were at the box office demanding their money back. We pay money to be entertained in theaters, many were not entertained and therefore received rain-check vouchers. Bottom line,... go rent Sixth Sense.<br /><br />This movie was a tall order to swallow. Shyamalan has let all of his followers down and really has failed the viewing community this time. Please like I said go rent something else or watch Clerks 2!!!!!\n",
      "Recently I watched a TV show that stated it was written by Writing credits by M. Night Shyamalan as a bedtime story for his children. He must have seen a rerun of the movie \"Mr. Peabody and the Mermaid\" with William Powell and Ann Blyth, as this is so similar to the plot that Guy Jones and Constant Jones should be getting credit for the writing.<br /><br />The story is excellent, however, it belongs to someone else as far as credit of the writing goes.<br /><br />For the man to find a narf in his swimming pool is what William Powell found on a vacation in the hotel swimming pool, except it was a mermaid. The man in Lady in the Water protects the narf, just like William Powell does in protecting Ann Blyth the mermaid. The man in Lady in the Water is trying to get the narf back to story land and in the William Powell movie he is trying to get the mermaid back to the other mermaids in the sea.\n",
      "The first time I saw the trailer for this film was about year ago inside a movie house. It showed a lot of promise, I was even mesmerized as it used Josh Groban's Mi Mancherai to great effect which left the viewer with such a teaser that I could not wait to know more about the film and its plot. Soon after wards a lot of internet hype went into this film based upon the fact that a lot of people are anticipating M. Night Shyamalan's movies. With the lackluster \"The Village\" as this film's predecessor it was time to look into a refreshing albeit familiar direction one expects of M. Night and after a year or so of waiting I finally saw it tonight. It is by far, the most unimaginative of all of M. Night Shyamalan's films and to me the most self-indulgent. Most of the time the film seems to be trying too hard to put that mystery and suspense that it feels contrived. I have also noticed a shift in his story telling style particularly his use of a lot of \"Hollywood special effects\" instead of the use of natural surroundings to create that distinct Shyamalan style of storytelling suspense which I loved and saw in his previous films. This feels like a sell out film and I think a wee bit egotistical to put himself as an important though not central character instead of his usual cameo appearance. This I think was the most detrimental to an already obtuse storyline. In closing, I think he should go back to the style that he became famous for and not try too hard to get lost in his own myth and persona.\n",
      "This was typical for the period, and is still true today. Caucasian bashing. This kind of \"reverse discrimination\" continues today. The picture began during the genesis of the Socialist \"Hippie\" movement, as an outgrowth of the \"beatnik\" to the \"social justice\" drumbeat of today's \"politically correct\" silencing of America's majority.<br /><br />Demonize the dominant culture and make them all appear as hate-filled morons. It was said before \"Chicanos good, Caucasians bad\". This is not really new. I wouldn't watch it again. There is no point to this malarkey. I would just as soon watch an anti-American flag-burning rally. I became tired of it at age 13 and I am tired of it now.\n",
      "I'm rarely if ever disappointed by any movies HBO makes, but I was disappointed enough with wasting two hours on this one that I felt compelled to say something. Anyone looking for a moving account of a profoundly tragic and shameful event in American history ought to keep looking. Don't get me started...<br /><br />OK, fine! If I came into this film with no understanding of how the US Government screwed the Sioux out of their land (and this was the case), I still have no idea how, when, where, or why this happened. Which land? Why was it so precious to them? Why did the US want it? What were the specifics of the homestead program we tried to impose? Why didn't the Sioux just take the money? The movie just throws you into the middle of their numerous town-hall sessions and expects you to know what's going on. The movie did nothing to capture the stark beauty of that land, the spirituality of the culture, didn't go far enough back to show you what they were missing, what they were trying to regain. It would have been nice to see a real buffalo hunt to recognize what a pathetic sham the reservation buffalo-hunt simulator was. The Sioux are just shown to be a bunch of stubborn, troublesome, raggedy refugees, so the sympathy just isn't there.<br /><br />How does Adam Beach keep getting work? I realize there's probably a scarcity of Native American actors out there, but this guy's the center of your story and he's got the emotional range of a light switch. He was awful in WINDTALKERS and he's awful here. You can really sense how lost he is playing off Anna Paquin and Aidan Quinn.<br /><br />What the heck was with those little photo-montage-transition thingies? The movie was slow enough without the director throwing those pictures in there to help bring it to a screeching halt multiple times. It's as if he was just trying to give a shout-out to the makeup people and casting agents: \"Ooooh, look how we made this guy look like THAT guy! Yay for us!\" If anything, it just helped embalm his story even more by tying it to the past with semi-relevant old tintypes instead of making it live and breathe. Whatever else he was going for, I missed it.<br /><br />Finally, we come to the climax(?) of the piece, the massacre itself, which is only recounted in a flashback, with no build-up, no clear nuts-and-bolts demonstration of the hate-whitey all-night rave parties thrown by the fed-up Sioux, and no clear motivation supplied by the men who sent in the soldiers. I'd have to watch it again, but they didn't even say how many people on both sides bought the farm, and it was an extremely bloody affair. If they were trying to present the whole story through the eyes of the doctor, I would have understood a back-handed recounting since he wasn't at the creek, but the movie switched narratives multiple times, so the directing and editing and even storytelling decisions don't build any tension at all. You could have had a Native American version of DO THE RIGHT THING here and you BLEW IT!!! One minute, everyone's huddled in blankets complaining about crummy treaties, and the next BAM!!! Dead, frozen Sioux.<br /><br />What happened at Wounded Knee is the crowning nightmare in a catalog of infamies done to our Native American brothers. I wanted to be angry after watching this, maybe even choked up a bit. No dice. Perhaps the most affecting moment in the movie is a closing title saying the Sioux have never to this date taken a dime for the Black Hills, implying that they're still doin' the Ghost Dance, waiting for Whitey to destroy himself (won't be long) so they can just move back in. When a closing title is the most compelling thing in your film, you're in trouble.\n",
      "This horrifying flick seems to do its best in blurring and romanticizing events so much that way things actually happened becomes romanticed and messed. Which is of course the main reason of the movie. Characters doesn't show most anything from real people, the events are of course 'based on actual guideline', but there's just that something(a lot) which doesn't fit in (too much uncorrectness to mention). <br /><br />Somehow, the Indian characters seem more white that they should (as most are played by Indian) and somehow white characters seem more like bureacrates than actual officers and congressmen. And of course in most conversations them (w.a.s.p.) get the last word. And of course them victims (massacred) weren't saints themselves, and of course them religious movement was actually hoax, and of course all of it happened in more romantic times in distant past. And besides of all these things, the film is actually quite boring.<br /><br />Some credit goes to guidelines in the end of the movie, which at least seem to be correct.\n",
      "This 1997 TV production is called \"Jane Eyre\", but except for a similarity to the plot of the novel there is preciously little in this film to remind you that you are indeed watching an adaptation of Charlotte Brontë's literary masterpiece. How they managed to get every single character of the novel wrong - except for Pilot, who is well cast - is a complete mystery to me, but they did. This is the more a pity because with Samantha Morton and Ciaràn Hinds they had two good actors, who even physically fit their roles well, but, alas, the greatest talent is of no avail when the concept of the characters is as wrong as in this adaptation. Samantha Morton - young, delicate and plain enough - looks like Jane Eyre, but does not play Jane Eyre. Her Jane is far too bold, even disrespectful at times, self-confident and self-satisfied, bossy and pert. Gone is the interesting duality of Jane's character in the novel, her outward shyness, guardedness and modesty on the one hand and her fire and passion on the other. Morton's Jane speaks her mind boldly right from the beginning and never stops doing so throughout the film. There is no subtlety in her performance, her Jane undergoes no change and no development. The same is sadly also true for the character of Mr. Rochester. Believe it or not, but they indeed managed to turn one of the most interesting and complex figures of English literature into a brute and a bully. Luckily Ciaràn Hinds possesses some charisma, but otherwise nothing links him to the eloquent and fascinating character of the novel. Not the slightest attempt was made to explore the depths of Rochester's character, his many contradicting facets, his moodiness, his inner struggle, his humour and his tenderness. The Rochester of the novel is admittedly insolent and harsh at times, but never the unrefined, snarling brute Ciaràn Hinds makes him. Yet Hinds is even worse at playing the loving Rochester, and the only feeling he manages to convey is lust.<br /><br />Unfortunately the misrepresentation of the characters is not limited to the leading roles: Blanche, besides being blonde, is not in the least haughty enough, not to mention the fact that she is nice to Adèle, St. John is all smiles and kindness, and the role of Mrs. Fairfax has been unnecessarily puffed up, probably due to the fact that she is played by dear Gemma Jones. Yet some scenes less with Mrs. Fairfax fussing around and some scenes more between Jane and Rochester would have been very helpful to make the audience understand why the two latter fall in love in the first place.<br /><br />As far as language is concerned this production is another victim of the delusion of some scriptwriters who either think that they can improve on Charlotte Brontë's brilliant language or that her 19th century English has to be simplified to become digestible for a modern audience. The result is that the dialogues are severely changed or replaced by the scriptwriter's own banal lines. In either case they have lost all the charm, sparkle and brilliance of the dialogues in the novel. Poor misguided scriptwriter Richard Hawley even deemed it necessary to make Rochester introduce one of his most famous lines - the line about the string that inextricably binds Jane and him together - with the words: \"I know it may sound silly but....\" No, Mr. Hawley, if somebody sounds silly here, it is definitely NOT Charlotte Brontë! Another capital error of judgement - and unfortunately also an insult to good taste - is the way they rewrote the farewell scene between Jane and Rochester after the aborted wedding, a scene, by the by, which in all the modern adaptations has received a particularly brutal treatment. Whereas in the latest Jane Eyre production of 2006 that scene was an outrage to Charlotte Brontë's Jane, the way the scene is handled in this adaptation is an outrage to Charlotte Brontë's Rochester. What? Rochester insulting Jane when she intends to leave him, bullying her, throwing her suitcase over the banister and telling her to go if she does not love him enough to stay? Absolutely ridiculous! It is hard to imagine what has gotten into the filmmakers to produce such rubbish as this.<br /><br />This is the worst, but there are many others scenes which are similarly absurd and ludicrous: the first scene of Rochester galloping in slow motion through the mist before he falls into a brook, Grace Poole coming out of the lunatic's room to sniff at Mason's wounds like a wild beast, Rochester sitting on the top of an archway of Thornfield as if he were the court jester and Mason jumping on horseback over the church fence to prevent a marriage of which he has heard only heavens knows how.<br /><br />Equally lamentable is the filmmakers' inability to represent the correct social behaviour of the 1850ies. Rochester and Jane are far too disrespectful to each other at first and later far too hot. Sentences like \"I feel that your passions are aroused\" are appropriate for \"Sex in the City\", but not for a costume drama, let alone Jane Eyre. Obviously the filmmakers decided not to bother at all - neither about being true to the novel, nor about portraying the novel's era accurately. The result is a sad failure - both as a film and an adaptation of Jane Eyre. The only fact with which the makers of this Jane Eyre can console themselves is that the BBC failed even worse in the subsequent production of Jane Eyre in 2006.\n",
      "While this is not the worse adaptation it did have its flaws which may keep the Jane Eyre fans cringing. Although shortened, I thought that the editing was reasonable. I didn't mind most the scenes they cut. I did find the updated dialogs annoying at times, because it often obscured the real motivations for the characters actions. I think that the writers of the screenplay were a bit uncomfortable with the religious undertones to Jane's goodness and for her leaving Edward. <br /><br />Now I think that Ms. Morton did not understand her character at all. She plays the scene where she first learns who Edward is in a very haughty way. She seems to think that Jane is some feminist archetype, bold and sassy...when in reality Jane, because of years of oppression at Lowood knew \"her place\" yet, was so good, she answered Edward's questions truthfully...even if her answers seemed bold. In a way Jane of the book was like a bird in a cage, it is only after finding that Edward wanted her to truly be free to be herself that she spoke more freely in his presence. He freed her...(not a popular modern outlook but the book was written some time ago). Jane only speaks up as the story progresses because of Edwards goading her, and her own desire to finally have a voice. Miss Morton also make some rather unusual facial expressions, she smiles when she hears she will meet the elusive Mr. Rochester...why?... just got yelled at by the man...why would she smile about the prospect of meeting him?Weird. It is like this \"Jane\" read the book and knew what was going to happen next.Yikes.<br /><br />Hind's Rochester at first felt spot on, moody...but then he just started yelling giving it a less than nuanced delivery. I would have fled, if I were Jane, because with all that yelling I would have been afraid of a man like that. I have seen him in the film \"Persuasion\" and found him wonderful...so perhaps direction was the problem.<br /><br />Another cloying aspect to this production is the general \"lightness\" of Thornfield. I guess I prefer a somewhat dark and gloomy place that hints at the horror that burdens Mr. Rochester...but on this note I will say this is a personal preference of mine. Others may find the scenery and set decoration more fitting and proper than previous versions.<br /><br />Did I hate this production? No. I think it does flow nicely. It has its high point in showing the passion. I also appreciate every telling of my favorite story. I do suggest that if you want to see a dark and mysterious version...try Orson Wells, or a more accurate version try the one with Timothy Dalton.\n",
      "The people who wrote this miniseries clearly read the Cliff's Notes instead of the book. I've read \"Jane Eyre\" half a dozen times; I turned this movie off maybe halfway through. I spent most of the time marveling at how the producers skipped over classic lines and moments from the book to invent dialogue.<br /><br />They glossed over Jane's early days -- her childhood and time at school -- and then rewrote the love story. The way Jane meets Rochester is wrong. His feelings about his French ward and the story behind her are wrong. The interactions among characters are wrong.<br /><br />See, what the filmmakers forgot is that the characters in this book have a strong sense of propriety. They are formal. Ranks mattered, and people behaved accordingly -- the passionate yet meek Jane and the moody yet tractable Mr. Rochester never forget their stations, and that influences their interactions. Samantha Morton's Jane is outrageously insubordinate and demanding from the moment she formally meets Rochester. It's simply out of character. Ciaran Hinds plays a decent Mr. Rochester, but he lays on the Grade-A jerk too heavily. Rochester isn't mean to Jane even if he is a bit gruff. Even the minor characters don't look the part. The best casting is Gemma Jones as kindly Mrs. Fairfax; she does a great job.<br /><br />I've always believed that film adaptations of books should honor the originals and follow them as closely as possible. You shouldn't take the characters and alter them to fit your audience, you shouldn't invent parts just to suit your needs, and you shouldn't cut parts for the same reason. This book has endured for more than a hundred years; it clearly has something going for it. Why mess with that? If you have read \"Jane Eyre,\" this movie is extremely disappointing. If you haven't read the book, it's not much better. The filmmakers get to the love story as quickly as possible, but Morton and Hinds lack chemistry, and their scenes of passion are actually quite funny.<br /><br />Give this one a miss.\n",
      "Few movies have moved me enough to write reviews on IMDb. This has been one of them. I have to voice my opinion about how terrible this movie is. I watched the movie because Ciaran Hinds was in it, and I normally LOVE his work. But just through his portrayal of Mr. Rochester in this adaptation of Jane Eyre, he has undermined my love for his acting. If I were him, I would refuse to play Rochester in the manner he has done in this movie.<br /><br />There are far too many things deviant and completely improbable in this movie. Mr. Rochester pointing towards Jane Eyre's breasts?!!!!! Mr. Rochester displaying affection openly for Adele????? Mr. Rochester acts too much like a lovesick schoolboy and Jane is far too cheeky.<br /><br />The more adaptations of Jane Eyre I watch, the more I realize that the only truly beautiful version is the Timothy Dalton - Zelah Clarke version. The beauty of that adaptation is beyond description. The story is faithful to the book, and so are the characters and their behavior. The dialogue is not frivolous or superficial or stupid, but follows the book almost exactly.<br /><br />I wish now that I had never seen the Hinds-Morton version. Please, even if you do watch this movie, do not deprive yourself of the pleasure of watching the Dalton-Clarke version.\n",
      "This movie was okay...as far as movie adaptions of novels go but it was not accurate with quite a few scenes:<br /><br />1. Whatever happened to Jane's realtionship with Miss Temple and her renounsing Brocklehursts punishment against Jane?<br /><br />2. What happened to Rochester being the fortune teller and tricking Blanche Ingram into telling him that she was only planning to marry him for his money? Also, his talk with Jane as the fortune teller was deleted.<br /><br />3. Jane DID NOT tell St. John Rivers her real name when she got there. She kept Jane and told him it was an alias and that she did not want to communicate with anyone.<br /><br />4. Why was it never mentioned that St, John Rivers was Jane's cousin? And that John Eyre died? Or, of the letter that he wrote to Jane from Madiera or the letter she wrote back to him?<br /><br />5. Also, the confrontation with Mrs. Reed at Gateshead was quite important. Mrs. Reed conveyed hereverlasting disgust with Jane and told of the arrival of her uncle Johns letter many years back.<br /><br />This movie lacked the spunk that the book did. Mr. Rochester was just a selifish, sarcastic brute. In the book, he was these things as well as imginative and lovable. I ,as a reader, was starting to fall in love with him as Jane was too. I was disgusted by the Mr. Rochester in this movie...<br /><br />If you liked the book, i wouldn't see this movie.. it was a waste of my time and will be of yours also.\n",
      "Did not enjoy the new Kojak one little bit. The opening to the pilot was supposed to shock, but I just laughed. Compared to the current 'gritty' shows out there, this sucked (no pun intended!!!!). The way it was filmed put me off straight away. With dodgy slow motion techniques which should now belong in the dark ages. This has nothing I haven't seen before. Compared to high quality shows like Sopranos, The Shield, Six Feet Under, Lost & CSI, this is just poor. Don't get me wrong, I like Ving Rhames, he's a class act. But I think he's making a big mistake with this. Perhaps it will get better once the series is shown over her in the UK, but I doubt it.\n",
      "I started watching re-runs of Law and Order on USA about the same time Kojak started to air, and I think it's safe to say that as cheesy as Law and Order can get from time to time, it beats Kojak by a mile. With the former, there is at least lip service given to trying to break the typical mold for a cop drama. However, with Kojak I am hesitant to call anything that happens a \"plot twist\" as any so-called plot reveal can be seen coming from a mile away. This show is nothing short of a caricature of the generic cop drama, and therefor Hollywood's interpretation of what it takes to make a cop seem \"bad\" and \"a renegade.\" I think it's a shame that the show's writers stoop to such lows to hammer home over and over that Kojak's a cop on the edge, willing to do whatever it takes to bring the bad man in, blah blah blah. This phony macho tough guy cop stuff is more overused than fart jokes on South Park, only in this case without the attached ironic humor. <br /><br />It's hard to like a show that panders to the lowest common denominator of cop show watcher so quickly in its run, especially when within five episodes the chief is already engulfed in a crime mystery. That kind of lame sweeps-week cop-out (I better copyright this stupid pun before the Kojak writers see it) doesn't usually surface in a series's long journey to the middle until their ratings take a nose-dive, seeing as how ridiculous and pathetic it is as a basis for an episode's plot. Just watching the 'african-american boy from hard times trying to make it in the white man's world while being pressured to become a hoodlum\" or the \"he's a deadly sniper who'll kill you in a second but he's got a family and a split personality that includes a heart of gold\" was enough to make me want to vomit and laugh at the same time, sort of a yuk-yak (back of Kojak, this one's mine too). Not only are these ludicrous ideas completely moronic, but they're done in such a heavy-handed way that there's no possible way to salvage any ability to be watched. <br /><br />I gave you five episodes Kojak. Congratulations, I can't watch any more. Good luck Ving when you inevitably return to the small-part tough guy roles in summer flicks you are destined to play.\n",
      "On the strength of Walter Matthau's ability with a character, the strong cast list, and the original Swedish crime novel-which was excellent-I watched the whole thing, unfortunately. As someone else on this forum noted, it works well for about the first 15-20 minutes, then decays into pointlessness. The main character's partner, played by Bruce Dern, is brought up short repeatedly when he makes wrong moves with witnesses, or says the wrong thing, so often that I expected an explosion. Which never came, and that thread finally went nowhere. A meeting with a group of Hell's Angels went nowhere, at least for the story. I could handle the dated costumes and social norms, but after an hour or so, it seemed as if that's all the film had to offer-a tour of SF's colorful corners in the Haight-Ashbury era, with a tacked-on murder mystery that came to no satisfying conclusion. It isn't necessary for every film-made-from-a-novel to stick exactly to the original, word-for-word, but the only good part of this film was that first 15-20 minutes, which is transported fairly closely from Stockholm, where the original was set, to San Francisco. Once the bus has crashed, and the dead passengers have been identified, It goes rolling straight down Potrero Hill and into the Bay.\n",
      "This film is based on one of an excellent series of detective stories set in the authors' native Sweden. Much of the interest of the books is their setting. Although they have the usual virtues of good detective stories, they are also a commentary on modern life in Sweden. I was therefore eager to see this film when it came out.<br /><br />Unfortunately, for inexplicable reasons the setting has been changed to San Francisco. This completely spoils it. Sometimes such a change is interesting or has no real effect, but in this case it destroys much of the interest of the film. We are left with a rather dull American police story.\n",
      "SPOILER ALERT! There appears to be irony in the title since THE LAUGHING POLICEMAN offers no laughs. The efficient director Stuart Rosenberg makes an efficient crime thriller (about a psychopath on the loose in San Francisco and the cops who track him) but unfortunately, it's little more than that. It's cold, sometimes slow and completely devoid of laughs, despite the presence of Walter Matthau, who managed to add at least some (black) comedy to even the bleakest films (FAIL SAFE, CHARLIE VARRICK). Nevertheless, Matthau is still fine and Bruce Dern is excellent as his unexpected partner. There's also a really fine performance buried in the film by Cathy Lee Crosby (as the distraught wife of Matthau's first partner). Lou Gossett Jr. is a less than patient fellow cop and Anthony Zerbe is Matthau's crusty yet benign superior. A massacre on board a public bus is a real highlight. It's quite frightening.\n",
      "A portrait of swinging San Francisco in the 1970's with a gloomy and uncomfortable detective investigating a mass murder, this opens well, but by the end has fallen pretty far. Reflecting mainstream America's discomfort at the time, most of Frisco's inhabitants are weird and sleazy, and the detectives by voice and acting show their hatred for the job and society. Matthau has job and family problems, and the family matters are a loose end that is never resolved by the film's end, nor is Dern's relationship with nurse. What's an even greater flaw is that the villain never says a word throughout the film. We hear Matthau rage about him, we see him hanging out in gay bars (to indicate his moral degeneracy), but not a single word of dialog passes his lips. It's like Matthau is swinging at smoke.\n",
      "Eight people are killed on a San Francisco bus by a greasegun-toting maniac, and one of the victims happens to be a cop who was supposed to be somewhere else. The combination of mass murder and losing one of their own sends the SFPD scrambling for quick answers, so they send out Bruce Dern and the dead policeman's former partner (Walter Matthau) to piece it all together.<br /><br />OK, that covers the first 10-15 minutes of film, and it's the only part of this 2 hour fiasco that makes any bit of sense.<br /><br />From this point on, the film turns into a jumbled, boring mess, filled with endless red herrings involving deviant sex, pimps, hookers, drug addicts and weirdos in general. No matter how closely you follow things and everything appears to lead nowhere, somehow the two detectives pull clues (and not very good ones at that) seemingly out of the air. This cyclical nonsense keeps rolling almost to the end, when finally, the policemen kinda/sorta/maybe think they have their man. In following the tone of all that's come before, the suspect conveniently makes a quick succession of unbelievably stupid moves to bring this impossible-to-follow disaster to a shoehorned-in conclusion. <br /><br />As if all that's not bad enough, we get to see what would normally be a solid cast looking pretty weak. Matthau seems as utterly bored as the rest of us, Dern's usual maniacal glee gets twisted into goofiness, and everybody else ends up stuck being colorless backdrop.<br /><br />I normally enjoy just about any gritty 70's police flick, but \"The Laughing Policeman\" doesn't even come close to making the grade. Please- Don't waste your time.\n",
      "Walter Matthau looks mighty dour throughout this grim, convoluted, exasperating crime-file nonsense. A public bus massacre in San Francisco, which included a cop amongst its victims, is investigated by the force, and Matthau is saddled with new partner Bruce Dern (he hates him on sight, how's that for originality?). The details of the case make little sense, and although the dead-end leads might reflect real-life police business, they don't do much for a plot already messy with loose ends and too many characters (all of them sordid). This picture looks as bad as it plays, with muddy cinematography and pasty-faced actors. The ignorant plot is jammed with clichés, and the screenwriter never shows a sardonic side to the madness. It's just violent TV made more violent for the movies. *1/2 from ****\n",
      "I thought Meenaxi was a self indulgent waste of time. The movie was poorly edited and artistic for the sake of being artistic rather being incorporated into the plot. Apart from the main protagonist, the quality of acting was mediocre and dialog was pithy. One of the two bright sparks was the choreography of the musical pieces, which were acrobatic and classical. Most importantly, they were a refreshing change from the usual bollywood crass belly gyrations. The other, positive (which is no reflection on the film makers) are the locations. It is hard to miss the beauty of cities like Jaisalmer and Prague. Overall, for some visual appeal and a cloudy plot-line, Meenaxi is watchable. But I would recommend getting on with household chores instead!\n",
      "what a depressing film this was! frank whaley stars as jim, a guy who finds himself narrating his his dwindling life saga to a near-empty room of strangers at each open mic night in a small town new jersey bar. he almost forces the crowd to listen to how each day seems as bad as the one before, with him getting fired from his job, his wife divorcing him, or having to care for his ill mother (although that doesn't seem to both him as much).<br /><br />i have always enjoyed frank whaley in comedy (although he does almost none of that anymore) but this does not really qualify as comedy, no matter how dark or satirical. although, there is one scene in the movie where jim is working at swamie hots, an Indian fast food place, where you get a little comedic shine on an otherwise horribly depressing film.\n",
      "I found it more depressing than funny. I was looking for more humor than sadness. It's it turns out to be very very sad. Everything turns for the worst for Jimmy. Everything that happens to Jimmy gets more and more depressing. He gets fired from the grocery job. He doesn't get any laughs at the comedy clubs. He keeps getting fired from his jobs. His wife leaves him. His grandma can't move on her own. His insurance is canceled. He is unable to buy his grandma's pills. It's all so sad. I only laughed twice and that's when his friend was moving boxes on the cart and they fall over twice. It's sad to see what happens to him and how he reacts to everything.\n",
      "A portrait of a \"regular\" guy, who spends his days barely getting by in a series of dead-end jobs, and his nights perfecting his comedy routine in a series of sparsely-attended \"open-mike\" sessions at local comedy clubs, this film fails to deliver anything but a depressing series of vignettes centered around it's main character, played by Frank Whaley (who also wrote and directed). How any would-be stand up comic could keep trying to be funny, and yet be so patently unfunny, and for so long, is beyond me; I've seen my share of mediocre comedians, but they all pale in comparison to Jimmy, whose depressing routines consist of what appear to be confessionals, centered around his miserable existence. And then we get to experience this miserable existence first-hand, as the film cuts between Jimmy's stand-up routines and his personal life. What is the point of this sorry exercise? Otherwise effective, and at times touching, performances by Carla Gugino, Ethan Hawke, and Mr. Whaley himself are wasted here.\n",
      "... Must admit well acted, but \"dark\" & depressing film portraying a wannabe stand-up \"comic\" .... with no clue toward humour. Viewed this film at The Stony Brook Film Festival. One of a \"book-end\" weekend topping off another Frank Whaley vehicle ... \"The Pursuit of Happiness\". Frank (and his brother Robert, as his Tops boss Mr. Slocum) & his buddy Ethan Hawke stand out in this film as hopeless \"common men\" ... stuck in a rut of Life's problems and of no seeing any chance of rising above it. Frank (Jimmy O'Brien) sees a calling as a stand up comic, but a mix of stage fright and overwhelming domestic problems, put him in a trance, undermining a \"true\" escape from his downward spiraling Life. See it for the acting (which is top notch), but as with earlier comments, if U need a feel good and less tragic movie see Frank Whaley in \"The Pursuit of Happiness\" .\n",
      "I wonder if everyone got together and thought it would be funny to make the worst movie ever. They did it somehow. I should have turned it off, but I kept watching thinking that there has to be something more...there has to be a redeeming quality. I was suspect of anything starring Frank Whaley, but I had read some favorable reviews. I wouldn't wish this movie upon my worst enemy. Please, I beg you, argue with me on this one. I want to know who got something out of this? What type of person was this made for? Maybe it is supposed to show you someone so pathetic you'll have to feel better about your own life. Listening to him complain and his whiny self-indulgence makes me want to take a shower. I know now what it must be like to be a psychiatrist. I had to sit and listen to it and I didn't even get paid.\n",
      "I kept waiting around for something redeeming to happen - it doesn't. As far as I could see, this was a totally pointless movie about a loser who never learns anything about himself. He is a self centered, self pitying person who never \"gets it\" - i.e., he is the problem. It makes me wonder - Who would put up money to make a movie like this? This was so bad!!!\n",
      "I was so disappointed in this film. I am a fan of the three leads. I thought Carla Gugino carried the film. Aside from that Jimmy's relationship with Ruth was touching. The context of the film was so depressing and angry. I ask why not give some hope for Jimmy and why end it without any closure for Jimmy. I am still spiraling downward with Jimmy. Frank Whaley is so talented that I could not believe this came from him. I hope next time he writes and directs he goes in a different direction. Frank has the talent to be a leading man and we already know he is a very credible character actor. Good luck to him and he can't go wrong working with Hawke or Gugino again.\n",
      "I watched this movie because I'm a fan of Ethan Hawke. Sad to say, there was little good about it. Frank Whaley always looked strained trying to get his part right, while Ethan appeared relaxed and natural. That's the difference between a want-a-be and an outstanding actor. The high light of the movie was when Ethan Hawke, playing an inept grocery store stocking clerk, kept dumping his load of boxes off the dolly. The part played by Whaley was of a loser want-a-be stand-up comic who could not make the grade and was never funny. The pathetic Whaley character was a thief (stole from his employer), drunk (what he stole was beer), argumentative individual (couldn't hold a job), and general misfit. As to the movie itself, it was a drag, repetitive in its plot with only the local changing. In other words, the plot was recycled every few minutes. In general slow and predictable, a bore to watch, and if you haven't seen it yet, don't waste your time.\n",
      "On the plus side, the acting is OK and the bleak atmosphere well sustained. But in place of a story we get a series of static and talky (because they come from stage-plays) and disconnected scenes, all much the same as one another. A string of shallow and unpleasant male characters strut about, spraying the testosterone, while all the women are pale and cowering mice, their only role to be threatened, humiliated and attacked by the men.<br /><br />The motive here is perfectly worthy  to give a feeling for a war-torn region  and the film approaches this by simply being relentless, which does help the atmosphere as noted. But soon enough we know what's going to happen almost before a scene begins and what should be shocking becomes merely tedious.<br /><br />This film is repetitive, dull, sexist, out of date in its attitudes and rather pointless. Nasty, annoying and a waste of time.\n",
      "Curious how so many people view this movie in the narrowest of terms, e.g. as an study/attack on \"male aggression\", as a comment on the personalities/politics of Serbs, & similar self-serving ideologic simplifications. I see this as a basic & pure allegory on the human condition. It could be Ireland or Zambia or a dozen other places, past, present & future. People love to kill people (& every other available living thing as well - see the article in the NY Times today about the devastation of gorilla & elephant populations in the former Congo). Serbians are better than most at depicting this because they're that much closer to the event. But none of us is terribly far from the ultimate human condition. We just pretend to be more civilized. This is a very good movie. Now watch Underground made a few years earlier with many of the same actors.\n",
      "Degrading rubbish like this should never be made.<br /><br />The sense of pointlessness lies not just in the fact that there's no story. It's possible to get away with having no story. Rather, every scene is part of some larger story we never see. Take the boxing scene. There's something pleasingly surreal, and yet accurate, about it; it's perfectly paced and the acting is faultless. It forms part of a grim story that I'm not sure I'd like, but at least, in the context of that story, it would pack a wallop. Here it's in limbo. Previous and subsequent scenes don't shed light on the boxing scene - they duplicate it. And really, only two of the countless incidents in the whole film show any kind of creativity and humanity: the boxing scene, and the confrontation between the `street punk' and the ex-policeman. That's all there is of value, and it's not much value. They're fragments of good films that were never made.<br /><br />Sure, this kind of work has an effect. It's a smorgasbord of things painful to look at: blood, bone-crunching, cocaine-snorting (something I find I simply can't watch), rape, hands bent backwards and rocks to the back of the head. It's impossible to watch the film without wincing at the constant brutality. And yet, so what? There are people who think that anything which \"provokes a response\" must be great art, but I've never heard anyone actually advance a reason for believing something so ridiculous, especially when the response is as automatic as a wince. I feel as if I've been served sour milk and then been told that I've just drunk something of aesthetic merit - because it made my eyes water.<br /><br />In Australia \"Bure Baruta\" went by the name \"Cabaret Balkan\", a title which makes it all the more clear how much inspiration Dejan Dukovski drew from Bertolt Brecht - and that's not a compliment. It's hard to think of anyone more fatal to imitate than Brecht. Brecht was a writer so talented he sometimes created beautiful parables despite his most earnest, theoretically motivated efforts not to; people who imitate Brecht are never so fortunate. They merely induce headaches.\n",
      "Simply awful. Yes, I 'get' it - war has shattered traditional notions of right and wrong, you can't tell the victims from the criminals, violence can happen at any time, etc.<br /><br />All of which provides a convenient excuse to make an entire movie of long, lingering, rape fantasies. A slobbering drunk accosts a young war widow on a train. A young punk with a knife threatens a girl on a bus. A man is held at gunpoint while his girlfriend is molested.<br /><br />Disgusting.<br /><br />\n",
      "This is a technically a very good film. The cinematography and the way the it contains stories within stories are excellent.<br /><br />However the actual stories within the movie and the general apocalyptic darkness mood is far from smart. Whether you hate or love the Serbs, it seems this film only further highlights their tendency as a people too shoot themselves in the foot be it in the world stage or as was the case in making this film.<br /><br />Can't think of too many other nations who would make a film that potrays themselves and their people as bunch of maniacs, murders, rapists, sadist and etc as this film has. It seems the Serbs have picked up where western media has left off. If I had not known better about them, having seen this film would have been enough to sway me in believeing that they deserved what they got from March to June 1999.<br /><br />This film is basically an excellent illustration of what sought of art results when an artist completely ignores his/her responsibility to his or her country and people in times of difficulty. I don't beleive that the content of the film can be justified in the name of 'art'. How about a positive film to come out of that country so the world can see some goodness in these people in contrast to what they have been made out to be.\n",
      "I saw this movie when it first came out and was impressed by its slacker(the film)-like construction. I liked the interweaving of characters, the Jarmusch night & pavement atmosphere, I even got off on the relentless pounding brutality, big-time irony, I felt, cool. Than I saw it again on cable, in my own living room, not in a chic lincoln center cinema, no trendy audience to share my titillation. And I saw something relentlessly ugly, like watching someone trying to convince you he needs treatment by slowly and progressively chopping off every part of his body. You watch in wonder and disgust. But what's the message?\n",
      "Certainly, one has to go deeper when talking about this movie. The scenes of violence are not the subject themselves, but rather \"vehicles\" to get you to a certain point. However, does that make a good movie?<br /><br />I experienced this movie as a big metaphor to many issues that were/are present in the Balkans. The quality of the movie is doubtlessly reflected in Paskaljevics ability to manipulate various elements and compose them to make effective points.<br /><br />One of the points that are being made by the movie is that everybody is getting hurt. And Paskaljevic makes it clear that there are no exceptions. As many of previous comments pointed out, one of the main themes of the movie is the question of guilt. As somebody previously noted, even the most innocent characters end up doing very wrong things (the bus driver). Is the whole thing somebody's fault? How did it all start? It seems to me that Paskaljevics wants to get across that it was all an accident!!! (The very beginning and the car accident scene). Are accidents anybody's fault? Why would somebody hunt you down, even want to hurt you if you scratched his old beetle?<br /><br />If one of the premises is that this movie comments on the situation in the Balkans (very likely does) at the end of the 20th century (And The Balkans include Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo among others), than I would feel very UNCOMFORTABLE in Paskaljevics shoes making such statement about accidents or everyone getting hurt equally with no exceptions. If you're not clear about what I am trying to say, try finding CREDIBLE history books about the events that followed the split of former Yugoslavia (what happened in Croatia, Bosnia, Kosovo among others).<br /><br />The moral dimension of such statements greatly destroys other interesting points like the History of Balkans in terms of \"war/peace\" cycles (The Boxing/Drinking scene \"as long as we're in good health\" mentality, etc.., - i think it was already mentioned before)\n",
      "This is a truly awful and irritating episode of the original Star Trek series. Off the top of my head, I can only think of one worse episode. The biggest reason is that the fundamental plot is just annoyingly stupid. It seems that the Greek god, Apollo, is living out in space on his own planet. When the Enterprise comes near, he seizes it and brings down selected crew members to worship him and live like Greek hippies. How stupid can you get?! They meet Apollo in space?! THAT Apollo?! Hello,...is it just me, or is this really dumb.<br /><br />Kirk, always the first to kill a god (see the awful STAR TREK V movie and the \"Val\" episode for more about this), orders a sexy crew member to refuse Apollo's love in order to tick him off--even though she really does think the guy is pretty buff and sweet. Despite being a starring player, I don't think she ever returns for a follow-up episode--too bad. And, once this occurs, they manage to kill off Apollo!!! Yeah, right. The less said, the better.\n",
      "Oh Gina, my lovely Gina, how bad have you fallen? Then again, you were never really an A-lister. Prey for Rock n' Roll features an all-girl punk rock band, but maybe hard rock too, in LA, supposedly in the late 90s or early 2000s. Jackie (Gershon) is the lead singer, who is turning 40 and still doesn't have success or a respectable recording contract. While the cast looks the part and the acting is decent thanks mostly to Gershon and Drea DeMatteo, the plot has several odd and un-realistic situations. 2 of the girls are lesbians, while another is bi-sexual. I didn't know straight rocker chicks didn't like punk. 2 of the bandmates were sexually abused when young, then one of them is raped, another dies in an accident, while the remaining one is a drug addict. The rapist has the word \"rapist\" tattooed to his forehead (oh wow). Why not send him to jail? According to the writers it seems, people in rock bands lead trash existences and suffer constant calamity. Funny, I've had many friends who were in rock bands and I can't recall any having such a decadent band history. And at least their music was decent. Clamdandy (where did they get that name?) had terrible music, I believe courtesy of Linda Perry, formerly of 4 non blondes (East Village crackehead supreme if there ever was one). Their songs simply weren't.....great. Also, the characters kept talking about the rock n' roll lifestyle that they ended looking to much like poseurs wanting to look like rockers. We never find out Animal's real name. The girls seem to have only one connection in the recording industry. The band performed too many of their songs on screen. Who becomes a rocker after watching Tina Turner? That would be R&B. One of the few bright spots is that Gershon's voice over narrative seemed cool and had some good lines. Oh and did I mention she looked hot in those pants!\n",
      "*** May contain spoilers*** Wow. This movie is really bad. It's so bad that the first word of the title is misspelled (I'd be willing to allow for the possibility of it being some awful pun if everything else didn't suggest that it was out of the intellectual league of the producers to allow for this. Also, the song of the same name in the movie indicates that it's supposed to be \"pray\"). The drummer, guitarist, and bassist were all well-cast and were pretty good in their roles... but the main character, played by Gina Gershon, is such a monumental bitch, it's hard to relate to her or her world unless you're the most hardened, bitter, negative person. She has this perpetual scowl smeared on her face and is incapable of not sneering or radiating this fake bad-ass attitude that instantly makes everything around her turn to sh*t. Which everything does, both in the context of the movie, and in the meta-context. And the plot itself a bit ridiculous, considering that her bandmate gets raped, another bandmate descends into serious drug abuse, and yet another bandmate dies in a freak accident-- all within the span of like a week. Oh, and she takes revenge on the rapist, who incidentally, is unconvincing as a realistic portrayal of a deranged nut. Somehow it's just hard to take it all seriously, and worse, Gershon's character really has a way of ruining the rest of the movie, contaminating it all with her bitter bile.<br /><br />And then there's the music. Jesus Christ. It's cliché in this bitter \"I'm too cool for life\" kind of way, where everything has this faux sleazy, sneering overtone that's frankly just embarrassing to watch. There are some points where it sounds moderately interesting, but then Gina starts singing and it's all over.<br /><br />I guess if you're into the rock'n'roll narrative, you'll find something to like about this movie; after all, this romantic notion of being hungry and breaking through to the mainstream has a certain appeal, but I just don't think it's done all that well here, either in a technical sense or in story-telling. There are signs that the writers have some talent, and are able to convey things subtly, but the larger narrative is not very compelling or capable of generating strong response-- although you will almost certainly hate Gershon's character.<br /><br />5/10\n",
      "I don't know what Gena Gershon's problem is, but oh my god it royally annoyed me during every second of this terrible movie.<br /><br />I find that in general, up-and-coming rock group movies leave a bit to be desired: The tale of \"The Commitments\" (1991) rapid rise to glory may have been watchable, but was just not plausible. \"Satisfaction\" (1988) was neither, and was just superficial to the core. \"That Thing You Do\" (1996) tried so hard only to achieve saccharine, dorky, false-rock results. But I'm sorry, \"Prey For Rock And Roll\" absolutely takes last place. It just sucks.<br /><br />Gena Gershon portrays a girl on the \"ragged edge\" of rock and roll, caterwauling for over an hour and a half in this movie. Her band plays the most painful, self-important, hook-less, uninteresting music heard in any of the above movies. Her performance is incredibly over-dramatic and overwrought in every way. And despite the volume of her voice, she is not a vocalist. If I saw this band live I would leave. It was so bad that I don't think I can ever look at this woman (in any movie) the same way again.<br /><br />Perhaps, some say, it was her character's personal anguish that led her to such tortured artistry. But don't be fooled - it is only the viewer who is tortured. I say perhaps she should have taken to visual art or maybe pantomime instead. Anything to avoid witnessing a primadonna, non-rock trainwreck like this. Abysmal performances and music throughout make this a pure headache. Yuck.<br /><br />The good news for rock group movie lovers is that \"The Buddy Holly Story\" (1978) is excellent, and \"Cotton Candy\" (also 1978) is so bad that it's good. Seek these out instead, at any price.\n",
      "overall, i'd say that this movie could have been worse. the scene where they kidnap & tattoo the rapist is worth it. the music was really lacking; the band's name was awful and the music was awful. drea dematteo (sp?) was the best part (Tracy) because she had the most authentic rock & roll lady thing going on...she must have done her homework on donita sparks (L7). there is (obviously) a rape in the movie, but you don't really see it--thank gawd. there is some awkward violence right before hand, but where most films would show the actual rape, the director cut to a black screen. there were a lot of predictable moments, but it was fun nevertheless. i believe it went straight to video, and i understand why.\n",
      "This is definitely one of the worst movies I've seen so far this year.<br /><br />Lori Petty = bad movie. I think Lori ruined the movie for me most of all with her whiny voice and annoying mannerisms. Every scene with her made me want to turn the movie off. I think what annoys me most is that she acts the same way in every movie she's in. <br /><br />As a female musician myself, I was disappointed with the music. I didn't feel that it \"rocked\" at all. So the bad music + Lori Petty = super bad movie.<br /><br />Gina's great, but not even she could save this one.\n",
      "It's very clear to me why the Outfest programmers chose to screen this film after the awards ceremony (so the viewers didn't get a chance to show their displeasure) and without a Q/A with the filmmakers afterwards (where I and the vast majority of others in attendance certainly would have voiced our displeasure): shame that they included it in a queer film festival at all.<br /><br />In 2003 there is NO excuse for films in which the only homo characters are either raped or killed, 2/3 of the queer women characters speak of childhood abuse (because of COURSE no one would be a dyke unless \"men did us wrong\") and the bisexual character ends up with a man in the end.<br /><br />Sloppy, misogynist filmmaking. Shame on the filmmakers.\n",
      "Pirate Islands is an utterly unremarkable children's television show along similar veins to the computer game Curse of Monkey Island, along with various other games and shows of the pirate nature. This show has many failings: effects, props, story, script. However, special attention has to be given to the cast, who are uniformely dreadful. The main girl is cast at least 10 years too old, while that Mars chap appears to be suffering a mild concussion. The man who plays the pirate captain Blueberry is overwhelmingly terrible, while Nicolas Donaldson does a fair job of wearing a green t-shirt for the duration of the entire series while displaying the acting ability of a coconut tree (many of which feature in the show, and are considerably more impressive). Not enough characters die, despite apparently being in constant mortal peril, which is a huge disappointment. This is possibly the worst series to feature an irritating singing plant, and an olive-green shirt. Avoid.\n",
      "This one has a promising video cover and an intriguing title (\"The Secret Of The Seagull Island\"), but don't be fooled (like I was). Its TV-movie feel is strong but could be forgiven if it achieved its goals in the other departments. But the \"secrets\" are unsensational, the plot is illogical and the pacing is plodding. The only two reasons that would make me give it one star instead of none are the well-shot underwater scenes and the not-bad acting. But it's still a waste of time.\n",
      "Rated E.<br /><br />I have played Pokemon Snap a couple of times on a Nintendo 64.There isn't much to say about this game but IMDb says I have to make the review 10 lines so I must.The only thing good about this game is the graphics.The graphics of the pokemon and the environment graphics are simply amazing.Great for Nintendo 64.The gameplay however is boring.You are a photographer and Proffesor Oak asks you to go to this island and take pictures of the different pokemon on the island.You must distract the pokemon by throwing fruit and other things at them.Pokemon Snap is a very boring game that's pretty to look at but not so fun to play.If you want a good N64 Pokemon game play Pokemon Stadium.<br /><br />4/10\n",
      "Nice promotional movie for the marine corps. However, it lacks depth. The characters are too superficial. I don't really get the point of this flick, it comes across as a promo for the army. It would've been nice to know more about the background of the characters, especially the women-recruits. I was kinda disappointed about that. Some parts were downright embarrassing. Everyone made it through the training, except the runaway. That's not realistic. No actor exceeded their (hopelessly)stereotypical character. The ending was a cheap shot and way WAY cliché. For would-be or wannabe soldiers it might be a nice movie, though. Personally, I'd go for Full Metal Jacket or Biloxi Blues.\n",
      "Every marine should see this movie? This was the same horrific crap that television execs put out every weekend. The real Drill instructors were very realistic of course. But the senior drill instructor was obviously an actor and not a good one at that. This movie was somewhat realistic but that ain't good enough. No movie can break down recruit training to the bare essentials in two hours, unless it was directed by me. The fake cheesy corps values that were portrayed were an insult to all marines.

      "Well I am a fan of the Vince Vaughn, Ben Stiller, Will Ferrel, etc. movies, but \"The Breakup\" was AWFUL.<br /><br />Let me say, it started off pretty funny, just like any Vince Vaughn movie. He did the monotoned funny monologue. The exposition of the movie is pretty amusing as you are introduced to everyone.<br /><br />Vince Vaughn works with his 2 brothers on a tour guide bus, and Jennifer Anniston works in an art gallery with a strange but funny boss and a gay, semi-drag-queen co worker, played by Justin Long from Dodgeball (in this movie he has long, straight, black hair and looks like a Chinese woman.) Towards the beginning, there is a scene where Anniston and Vaughn's families meet at dinner and you realize how Vaughn and Anniston's relationship is slowly declining...that is where it lost its spunk. ^ that scene is about 20 minutes- the rest is boring and not funny.<br /><br />As soon as they start fighting, the rest is them just whining and being mad at each other and thinking of ways to make each other jealous with Anniston going on dates and Vaughn having parties with his friends.From there, there is the occasional amusing line and the scene where you see Jennifer Anniston's butt.<br /><br />Even after breaking up, they still live together in their apartment because they need a place to live, and they have continuous disputes about whose room belongs to who (annoying). Jennifer Anniston starts to realize that she wants him back and invites him to a concert for a casual date. He does not show up, and she goes home and cries and whines. He explains to her that he wanted to go but blah blah blah. She tells him (while crying) that all she ever wanted from him was a little appreciation. This hits Vince Vaughn and he shows his appreciation.<br /><br />While she goes out one day, he cleans the house and makes dinner for her, and he does the \"I love you, I'm never going to hurt you\" cliché speech, and she has the non-cliché reaction- she tells him that she does not love him and they wind up selling their apartment. They both go their separate ways: he continues his tour guide business, and she travels for a while. They meet a few months after, and do the \"it's good to see you! you look great! how you been?\" conversation. You can definitely see that they are hiding their emotions behind their smiles and that they still want to be together. Then the best part of the movie happened. . . IT ENDED! I yelled \"free at last!\" after it ended.<br /><br />The movie is tedious, boring, and not amusing.\n",
      "Well well well, this film was simply atrocious. The worst film I have seen in the last two to three years.<br /><br />The breakup advertised as romantic comedy is anything but. I can't begin to describe how disappointed I was sitting through this movie.<br /><br />Nothing made me relate to the characters and their infantile behavior. They both came across as whining spoilt brats.<br /><br />The pace of the film is slow and pointless. Arguments, shouting and bickering don't make for light or romantic entertainment.<br /><br />Silly \"votes\" between good friends as to who is staying at the bowling game are just cringe factor, good grief do people really behave this way? certainly not my circle of friends. It was just embarrassing to watch.<br /><br />Not much redeeming in this film a few short laughs, one of the better ones being when their real estate agent friend offers to sell their home and wants to do so at no commission. BUT unfortunately company policy wont allow it so he has to charge it hahaha that was the funniest bit in the film. How sad :( I would have given it one star except for that real estate agent part LOL.<br /><br />AVOID THIS FILM AT ALL COSTS !!! A great gift for that person you don't really like but have to buy for appearances sake :)\n",
      "'The Break-Up' is not funny. It's been marketed as a comedy, but it certainly isn't. The constant arguing between the two lead characters and their childish attempts to get back at one another are not entertaining. Unfortunately, this is pretty much all there is to the movie. We never get to see what it is that they like about one another. What do they have in common? Why were they attracted to one another in the first place? Why did they fall in love? These questions remain unanswered and as a result I found that I didn't actually care whether they broke up or not. <br /><br />The only interesting parts of the movie for me came courtesy of the excellent supporting cast (all of whom were under-used). Johnny O (John Favreau), Riggleman (Jason Bateman) and Marilyn Dean (Judy Davis) were the only characters I actually liked. Favreau was of course very funny as always, but only has a handful of scenes, and his knack for comedy is largely wasted. I would also liked to have seen more of talented 'Arrested Development' star Bateman. He has remarkable comic timing and a strong screen presence which could have really added to this film. But, unfortunately, the focus is squarely on Aniston and Vaughn, who fail to make their characters interesting or even likable. <br /><br />I really wanted to like this movie, but I didn't really enjoy it.\n",
      "Over a 2-day span, I went to go see this, and The Fast and The Furious: Tokyo Drift. There was a 2-3 vote for Tokyo Drift over this movie, and in this case the majority was right. The storyline was overly cliché'd, and had far too many big coincidences. The acting, which some say was great, I found horrible. As usual, I found Vaughn and Aniston playing their usual characters. Aniston reminded me of \"Bruce Almighty\" and Vaughn reminded me horribly of my least favorite scenes of \"Mr. and Mrs. Smith\". The saving grace of this film was Vincent D'Onofrio, a superb actor, who pulled off his role extraordinarily well.<br /><br />As for the plot... it's pretty much the title. But as for billing it as a comedy... It was funny, at points, and I'll admit that as a comedian, Vaughn shines, where some funny moments got me to look back at the screen, but the overall flow of the movie was lacking, and a good plot wouldn't need funny jokes to get my attention back. The ending actually surprised me, however, because it was not your typical romantic comedy ending. However, seeing as I wouldn't classify this as a \"comedy\" for most intents and purposes, that makes sense.<br /><br />All in all, the mostly sub-par acting and the yawn-worthy script left much to be desired by this over-hyped summer film.\n",
      "This was truly one of the very worst movies I ever saw. Though it started on a promising note, after five minutes I found myself guzzling an extra-large coke, just so I would have the excuse of going to the rest room to get away from it.<br /><br />My wife and I wanted a light-hearted evening away from the kids, and this movie looked promising. But light hearted it was not. We have a very peaceful life in our home, and I was unprepared for the amount of yelling that was dressed up as dialog. There wasn't anything funny about it. Probably 70% of the dialog consisted of people yelling at each other.<br /><br />We were probably taken in by the trailers, which made the movie appear a bit humorous. The only problem is that all the funny parts were in the trailer. Nothing else was a bit humorous.<br /><br />The only good parts were the first and last songs. The last one, \"I Can See Clearly Now\" made me see clearly why I should never go to an Aniston or Vaughn movie again.\n",
      "This has got the be one of the least entertaining movies I've seen. Absolutely never ever had as little a shy smile on my face, there just aren't any jokes worth laughing about in this movie.<br /><br />Both Vince and Jennifer's characters are not appealing to me. They are flat, undimensional and tiresome.<br /><br />The antics shown are also completely un-inspired.<br /><br />I was very disappointed by this movie.<br /><br />The only thing I found refreshing, and here be spoilers, is that at the end, very UN-American, they don't get back together again.<br /><br />But that isn't enough to warrant this movie a viewing.\n",
      "Well, everyone seems to be concentrating on the fact that this was advertised as a romantic comedy and it is neither romantic, nor a comedy. That is definitely true.<br /><br />Aside from that, however, it is a poorly-made movie. The timing is off (comic and otherwise), the editing is off pace, and the writing is clunky. I've read a lot of user comments that mention the fantastic \"depth of character\". Let me just say that having characters that act like immature jerks instead of typical movie star characters does not automatically qualify as character developmentit's just different and new, not real \"character development\". There are many characters that we get to know a little and are left with NO wrap-up for. The main characters are the only ones we get closure for, but even they are not people we really care about by the end of the movie. I felt when we left the theater that Aniston and Vaughn had so little chemistry it's hard to believe they developed a romance off the set.<br /><br />The biggest problem is consistency. If you're going to make Vaughn's character a beyond believable inconsiderate jerk, this same character would not make a 180 degree turn around after a short erudite \"pep talk\" from his bartender friend. By the same token, if you're going to make Aniston's character the kind of person who would put up with this behavior for so long, she would NOT in real life totally change her mind about him a few days after sobbing in her bedroom about their relationship when he finally makes the list of changes she wants (minus the bowl of lemons and ballet tickets he should have had on that table with the dinner).<br /><br />As an aside, I know that I am probably the only one who feels this way, but the language was much rougher than I was expecting. If you go to see Lethal Weapon 18, you expect F's and GD's galore, but it really took me by surprise in a romantic comedy, especially since there are so many GD's in the first 15 minutes of the movie. I just mention it for the record.<br /><br />All in all, I would pay another $15 just to have that two hours of my life back. And while we're at it, I am really sick of the marketing geniuses advertising movies in such a way that you have no idea what you're walking into. It makes the viewer give it even worse word-of-mouth than they would have otherwise. You can bet I've already written an email to all my friends telling them what a huge disappointment this movie was and to avoid it.<br /><br />To sum up: Sloppy execution, poor characters, inconsistent follow-through, and a really crappy ending. Save this one for DVD",
      " and even then, wait for it to be taken off the \"new releases\" wall so you don't have to pay as much for it, or better yet, maybe you'll get lucky and your library will carry it and you will be able to pay NOTHING for it",
      " which is basically what it's worth.\n",
      "The basic premise of this film could have been vehicle for a thousand gags and one liners. However, this film tries to take itself a little too seriously for being touted as a comedy. There is some funny shtick buried in this film, but it is spread way too thin to be called a comedy. It does have a chance to redeem itself in the romantic category right up to the end, but literally turns its back on what the audience is expecting - No happy ending. As a result it turns a great premise into a dark comedy and reflects a sad slice of life. Instead of a dark successful comedy like 'War of the Roses', we end up with a film that falls flat. My guess is that the director tried to please everyone with this film instead of following his vision of what the film should be. The resulting film will end up doing poorly even as a DVD rental.\n",
      "This is one of those types of movies where they show most of the funny scenes on the TV trailer. There were some scenes not shown in the trailer that made me smile but at no time did I actually laugh out loud.<br /><br />Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Aniston had no chemistry together at all. The movie just dragged on and on. This is a comedy? It had more sad and angry scenes than funny ones. Kind of reminded me of The War of the Roses.<br /><br />The ending of this movie is just horrible! People don't go to the movies and pay money to watch an ending like this.<br /><br />I saw this movie with my friend and she disliked it even more than I did.<br /><br />If you have to see this movie you should wait for the video, but even then you might be disappointed.\n",
      "Does anyone remember \"About Last Night\" with Rob Lowe and Demi Moore. Two people meet fall into a relationship and move in together. Then the couple has a fight and proceed to follow the advice of their friends instead of their hearts and winds up more deeply in love and understanding of one another but separated.<br /><br />Rob Lowe meets Demi Moore at a company softball game. Vince Vaughn meets Jennifer Aniston at a pro baseball game. They fight and break up and follow the advice of their friends. Rob Lowe listens to his buddy in the bar Jim Belushi (and at work). Vince listens to his buddy at the bar Jon Favreau, Vince has a brother giving him ill-advice at work. Demi Moore listens to Elizabeth Perkins. Jennifer listens to Joey Lauren Adams. Doing a nice comedic turn as usual.<br /><br />Neither are getting good advice and screw up the relationship badly, till it is almost unrepairable. This was like an extended episode of the TV show \"Men Behaving Badly\" mixed in with an episode of Oprah on proof that Men Don't Listen! <br /><br />STAY AWAY........STAY AWAY....... unless you think Jennifer got a nice tush and you want to see it.<br /><br />At least Rob Lowe and Demi Moore had on screen chemistry. You want to see them make it. I laughed at all the wrong moments in the Break Up.<br /><br />Rob Lowe and Demi Moore ride off into the sunset at the end of their movie. She rides her bike and he runs after her.<br /><br />****SPOILER ALERT**** <br /><br />At least the Break Up didn't cop out at the ending. They don't get back together. They run into each sometime later. They only give you a hint that they have feelings for each other without laying it on too thick.\n",
      "Vincent D'Onofrio's only got 4 scenes in this. They add up to maybe 10 minutes of the film. His scenes are decent, amusing, quirky as his fans have come to expect from him, but nothing particularly outstanding in his long career of solid performances. There's no rush to lay out $5-$10 to see 'The Break-Up', just have NetFlix ship it to you in a couple of months.<br /><br />Jason Bateman is fantastic as Riggleman the real estate agent. He's perfectly smarmy and subtle and amusing. Too bad there isn't more of him in this film Everyone else is pretty much a disappointment...what I want to know is if you're not allowed to connect to the alleged romance (you never really see any PDA (physical display of affection) or signs of affection and tenderness between them until it's a foregone conclusion that their 'relationship' is history) between Brooke and Gary, how could you possibly *care* about their breaking up? Vince Vaughn's a huge disappointment (he was great in 'Thumbsucker', so if you're not familiar with that film, go rent it instead). As always Jennifer Aniston did *nada* for me -- I still don't get her appeal so I can't recommend something else she's done (sorry, you're on your own here Jen fans).\n",
      "The movie was nothing but interpersonal conflict. The role played by Vince Vaughn was a shallow, waste of time and the role played by Jennifer Aniston started to reciprocate in kind... it was nothing but nasty conflict... my wife and I couldn't watch the whole thing it was so snide and petty... we put in Elizabethtown instead and LOVED that... don't bother with \"The Breakup\"... not worth the rental fee... or time. Also, you might like \"The Great Raid\"... we loved that also... We are big fans of \"The Princess Bride\" and \"Galaxy Quest\" etc and didn't care for the constant conflict of \"The Breakup\". We though \"The Breakup\" was going to be a comedy... it was a tragic pile of interpersonal failure...\n",
      "Not even watching babealiscious Jennifer Aniston makes this movie tolerable. In fact you will probably come away liking her a whole lot less if you see her in this. Never have figured out whatever appeal Vince Vaughn has for some people. He would be a mediocre actor at best if his flat emotionless monotone delivery wasn't so terrible. Think Schwimmer and Romano. This disaster starts off with him laying some ridiculously implausible pickup line on Aniston at a baseball game. Then 30 seconds of photo album shots defines their whole relationship up to the break up. Then your off on apparently an hour and a half of non-stop arguing, and not even believable arguing but stupid crap like Vaughn sticking a pool table in the living room of their condo. I say apparently based on reading other reviews here because I could't stand more than about 40 minutes of it. This movie is the antithesis of funny. Its not romantic, dramatic or clever and (ladies) if you drag some poor schmuck out to see it on your first date it will probably be your last.\n",
      "This is a tough one! I am viewing this film in December of 2006. I know it was released at least 3 or 4 months ago although with films in this category the distributor is pushing to get it to video release as soon as they possibly can because the video release is where much more money can be made and in this case video release will surpass domestic profits. However, you are not reading this to hear about how the distributor makes money... I watched as PPV on home cable after reading some reviews and taking in the marketing several months ago, and only because I like Jennifer Anniston and I was bored with X-Mass shopping and am not very familiar w/Vaughn.<br /><br />Anniston's film 'The Good Girl' is how I became hooked on her. I watched 'Friends' seldom but when I did, it was because I liked looking at her. 'The Good Girl' is J A at her best. Prior she was not pulling in audiences as one would think she would after Friends. Her previous films did not make money for the production companies to actually allow her to continue making films as a 'star' and I believe based solely on her performances on Friends was she cast in other films, all the while the producers would dump cash into her films hoping she would hit that one big starring lead to allow them to justify another J A starrer.<br /><br />\"The Good Girl' was so good but yet made no more than her previous attempts in film work (I would imagine rentals put her over the top because rentals are rented mainly based on consumer 'word of mouth').<br /><br />I'm generalizing here and simply writing as I watched her career slowly fade (I.e.: I have completed no research on J A and her films but writing simply as a consumer watching what was going on with her career) until 'The Good Girl showed up on the radar screen of the possibility, the potential of a possibility for JA to find a niche for her considerable talent. I believe Good Girl was a big 'critical' success which will always make studio heads turn. 'The Good Girl' was so good and on a 'real life' level that if you have not seen this film do so now. You will be blown away by her subtle but deeply felt ability to sweep you away from your troubles for 90 minutes.<br /><br />Thus, based upon the GG showing blatantly her abilities for film work once a DECENT script is placed in front of her and her sheer talent we all know is there (why do you think H'wood keeps remaking and extending sequels...no freaking writing is going on out there.) she gets to make more of this genre' which is a shame because she is capable of much more than the horrid 'Break Up' and I am afraid she will be stuck in this type role. Certainly on one level she does not mind as I imagine she is paid very well as the women love her in this 'Break Up' sort of waste of film. <br /><br />Nevertheless, JA as a \"STAR\" right now and not an \"ACTRESS\" has to be frustrated not even mentioning her personal life.<br /><br />I have been wanting to get all the above thoughts down somewhere where someone MAY read them, although as you begin reading and notice this is not about this film specifically but about J A, you may skip over this 'review. I will tell you what I thought of 'Break Up', though: a true and real BORE. However, watching JA was a treat. The script was poorly written, the direction was bad, the casting was OK, and frankly, the supporting actors were more entertaining than the entire film taken as a whole. Generally, in most anything, you are usually only as good as those surrounding you and although JA tried, she could not carry the film herself and end up with an enjoyable product.<br /><br />My god when I think of that script and most of the dialog I want to cringe. Vaughn who was fun to watch as a fast-talking slob who tries, grabbed me more this time. <br /><br />Think about it, if someone meets over a hot dog at a baseball game and he essentially bullies JA as to what HE thought best, then you deserve what you get.<br /><br />I have been there, I deserved what I got, and it was not fun.<br /><br />This film made production budget wise at 150 mil (But when you see that figure multiply by 3 for what the film really cost in marketing and prints the production company (distributor) has to get to the screen and all the other costs involved.)<br /><br />Look at the video rentals of this film at what, 50 mil? it made a reported 350m worldwide but there are many more ancillary ways of picking up revenue domestically and foreign, so at 450mil they may have made a few dollars allowing JA to TRY AGAIN.<br /><br />Rent 'The Good Girl'. There is the real Jennifer Anniston. Moreover, I hope she can break out of the mold she has been cast in. Julia Roberts did it so can J A!!\n",
      "\"The Break-Up\" (2006) <br /><br />Directed By: Peyton Reed <br /><br />Starring: Vince Vaughn, Jennifer Aniston, Joey Lauren Adams, Jon Favreau, Jason Bateman, Judy Davis, & Justin Long <br /><br />MPAA Rating: \"PG-13\" (for sexual content, some nudity and language) <br /><br />\"The Break-Up\" is probably most famous for sparking the famous relationship of Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn. Think about it as the \"Mr. and Mrs. Smith\" for the couple. The only difference is that \"Mr. and Mrs. Smith\" was a fun, entertaining movie and \"The Break-Up\" is anything but. In fact, this is one of the least entertaining and joyless movies I have seen this year. We all know how hard and awkward break-ups can be. \"The Break-Up\" analyzes this with very little compromise. In fact, it puts this failing couple into one of most awkward situations imaginable--having them share a condo until they can sell it. The real question, though, is not how they will handle this situation",
      "but, why should we really want to see it? Why do we want to see two people bicker and complain for an hour and forty or so minutes? Why do we want to experience all of the awkward moments that come with this scenario? The answer is that, of course, we don't want to do anything of these things. Herein lays the problem with \"The Break-Up\". It is a movie that we just don't want to see filled with characters we don't really care about.<br /><br />Gary Grobowski (Vaughn) and Brooke Meyers (Aniston) were once a loving couple who had everything they thought they needed: each other, a wonderful condo, and jobs that were certain to propel them to bigger and better things. But, now, the relationship is over and neither of them can afford to pay for the mortgage without each other",
      "and so they are having to sell, but, until they find a buyer, they must live together. Both, still bitter over the difficult break-up, decide to make each other miserable by flirting with other people, inviting loud friends over, quartering the condo up into different compartments, and more. But, will they realize that they really do love each other and reconcile",
      "or is this break-up for good? If you have ever watched a romantic comedy, you know that the entire movie circles around you wanting desperately for the couple to be happy and together at the end. I didn't feel that way at all about the couple in \"The Break-Up\". In fact, I only wanted them to go their separate ways and to stop the annoying arguing and the backstabbing. Vince Vaughn's character, Gary, in particular, was horribly annoying whenever Aniston's character, Brooke, was around, and, while Brooke was at least likable, many of her actions seemed mean and reprehensible. How could anyone want these two to get together? The relationship was just bothersome and aggravating.<br /><br />How could \"The Break-Up\" not work? It had a great cast and the director of \"Down with Love\" (a bitter, yet hilarious romantic comedy) and \"Bring It On\" (a hip, edgy teen comedy) behind it? This movie seemed like a sure bet and yet it just doesn't work. It isn't romantic. It isn't funny. It is awkward and the constant arguing gets old very quickly. The characters, themselves, are indeed very strange--almost like parodies of real people, but the movie takes itself far too seriously to allow them to seem realistic. The two main characters are not made out to be people we can really care about. Gary, especially, is despicable for the majority of the movie and Brooke, though the only main character with which we can sympathize, does her fair share of mean things. On top of all of this, where was the humor? Was this supposed to be a comedy? If so, then it is one of the least effective comedies of the year. On a warmer note, Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn give great performances and the actual break-up (and ensuing arguments) are handled realistically. The only problem is: why would anyone really want to see them? <br /><br />Final Thought: Despite good performances from the leads, \"The Break-Up\" is an awkward, unfunny movie that fails to engage its audience.<br /><br />Overall Rating: 4/10 (C+)\n",
      "I should start by admitting that I find Jennifer Aniston adorable.<br /><br />Vince Vaughn is every fast talking overly-confident friend I've ever known.<br /><br />This film could have been great. It isn't.<br /><br />It is a weak film full of odd underdeveloped (and thus unexplained) side characters and it contains one of the most unsatisfying (and the biggest 'cop-out') endings ever put on film.<br /><br />If I want inadequate, unfunny, unsatisfying and realistic, I'll refer to my own struggling relationships. I don't need to pay Hollywood top dollar to show me that. I can get that for free.<br /><br />It has its hints at humor, but overall? Awful.\n",
      "Brooke (Anniston) is quite tired of making the relationship with Gary (Vaughn) work as Gary sees no need to change his ways. So they break up.<br /><br />I can see why Anniston and Vaughn are no longer together in real life. After this flat-liner no one would want to be associated with it. These are two good actors(Vaughn is good when he doesn't try to be comedic), but nothing they do saves this movie. There is no chemistry between them and it shows on the big screen. You don't care if they break up, and get back together. You just want this to be over. You are waiting for something funny to appear to make things a little less tight. Never happened. I blame the script, maybe Vaughn but never Anniston, who is turning out to be a really good actress. Yes, she was the best thing in here. But this is supposed to be a comedy and I want to say it's light drama, but cannot. It is almost heavy drama. Something no one expected. This could have been something akin to the War of The Roses, but falls far short of that classic.<br /><br />Why blame the script? Because I have seen Rachael (Anniston) get mad at Ross (from the Friends TV show) and break up with him and the results were funny, funny, funny, and that didn't happen here. Another reason to blame the script is that Vaughn helped write it. Maybe he should have asked Jennifer to help out with that. Ya think? I just don't picture Vaughn as someone comedic (no, I didn't find him funny in The Wedding Crashers either) and believe he is best suited for crime drama where he will excel, but that's just me.<br /><br />The rest of the cast were fine. Ann-Margaret had a small part in here too. But, there was that irritating family dinner where some family members sang acappella and that was extremely irritating and annoying. That was a harbinger of things to come. Again, look to the script.\n",
      "What should have been a good story with a capable cast was actually hard to watch for me. Each scene seemed to be performed without any regard to the ones previous or following, and HD actually calls Jolie \"Jolly\" at one point (and no one caught such a basic mistake, which could have been easily corrected in post production audio work).<br /><br />The ending was predictable, and disappointing in its execution. Once the final scene was underway, the acting ended, and the audience was never treated to anything like a finale that would've tied up the loose ends.<br /><br />Unfortunate, given the talent available (and the cameo by Mickey Rooney).<br /><br />Sheesh.\n",
      "I am always looking for movies set in Texas/Oklahoma, etc. in modern times (post-cowboy days). I expected this one to be little corny, but I was not prepared for just how bad it was. Even though it had some decent actors, they all did a terrible job or were given a terrible script and direction in this flick. Ben Johnson is one of my all-time favorite actors. Compare this to \"The Last Picture Show\" and he comes off as a crude redneck with emotions that I'd expect in a kids movie. Characters changed moods and attitudes from one sentence to the next. The arguments were totally irrational and disconnected. Unless you're desperate to watch bull riding and wranglers, don't waste your time with this pitiful movie.\n",
      "This is a film that may captivate those interested in Catholic theology - others should stay away. There is too much chat, as a futuristic (set in 1999) priest visits a monastery in Ireland that refuses to give up the Latin mass. Not very exciting stuff.<br /><br />But there is a marvellous performance from Trevor Howard, an almost as good one from Cyril Cusack, and it's nice to see young Martin Sheen and Michael Gambon. Scenery and cinematography are also nice.\n",
      "All the while I was watching this movie I kept asking myself, Do the authors of this mediocrity understand what being catholic is all about? There's, of course, the modern \"socially-concerned-Hollywood\", which depicts the Catholic Church as a decadent, senile and misoginous group of eunuchs and frigids, emotionally frail and codependant, obsessed with sex and rites, completely ignorant of the true meaning of human dignity and who do not understand that this church has to accomodate its ideas into the most common idiosincresies in order to take its place where it belongs: equal to and along all other churches, because they're all alike and none holds the absolute truth. So they make films like \"Catholics\", \"Priest\" and \"Stigmata\" to denounce how truly hipocryt this church really is, and how courageous are the ones who defy it.<br /><br />The point is that such perception has nothing to do with what being Catholic really means and what the Catholic Church is in fact. Their conrnerstones are Faith, Hope and Charity, and it's precisely because all faithful are united through Christ where its meaning relies on. A film that argues that the Church might enforce the abolishness of Mass based on obedience is absurd precisely because such obedience is based in the Holy Spirit. Furthermore, such argument is exactly the one some protestant churches and sects sustain: that you alone can be the judge of your relation with God regardless of the means He established to grant His grace.<br /><br />Any writing on the future of the church should recall perhaps how early christianity was like: people who gathered and grew in their faith regardless of its mainstream social acceptance, and who knew that they should not trade its teachings for social popularity.\n",
      "Why L to K? Because that makes as much sense to me as the concept of this movie likely has for the director. This film suffers where many first time films fail (gay or straight) when a director chooses to film their own script. In this case, he also did the cinematography. The film is very impressionistic and also very slow. It takes some digressions, a few brief ones and one long one (the soccer player subplot), which in spite of some comments on here, really accomplishes nothing to advance the development of the main character that could not have been accomplished more logically, otherwise. The other flaw in this movie is the lack of logic. As an example, if Marie has goals and ambitions, in spite of whatever feelings she may or may not feel for Loic, why would she commit suicide, particularly if she had already sent him from her life. There is no rationale in some of the action in the film other than the director obviously did not know how to push the plot forward.<br /><br />As a coming of age story, this is very weak. As a movie, the plot made little, if any sense. As a movie about the interior development of a character, of his realization of his place in society and the world, the movie suffers from an inconsequential lead with little to offer other than (at least apparently based on some reviews here and elsewhere) what some view as good looks. That is not enough to hang a life on, much less a 90 some minute film.\n",
      "I don't see what justifies the rave reviews. Apart from the exposition, it came off fairly boring. Yes, Loic is enigmatic and incredibly attractive, and the film could have developed well based on that, but instead it wanders hopelessly after its first 20 minutes and becomes essentially 90% talk and 10% plot. That gets old fast. Even the few unusual \"incidents\" toward the end -- which I'd guess are there to provide a shock or epiphany -- seem pointlessly surreal.<br /><br />The director indulges a number of disconnected fetishes for no apparent purpose. What are we supposed to make of the recurring shots of the Alps, or the distressed and always-bandaged eyebrow piercing? If these are supposed to be symbolic of something about Loic, their meanings are far too obscure. If the writers intended to make us guess at these things, that's a tired, pretentious technique that I think ends up being merely annoying, not clever.\n",
      "What is wrong with homo flicks ? This one starts with a good idea and bogs down into utter confusion. The next step is complete oblivion.<br /><br />A nice actor portrays a young and ignorant man from Gruyère who refuses to commit, refuses to envisage his relationship beyond raw sex cruised on the internet. <br /><br />He lets a nice girlfriend escape him and tries to reinvent his life. Gradually he reflects on himself and thinks about cultivating his brain and shedding his quite meaningless existence (there does not seem to be much physical pleasure in it !). An interesting theme for a quite boring film.\n",
      "Too long and too slow; the plot is difficult to follow and unnecessarily obscure;in addition, the permanent noises , especially of trains, makes it difficult to hear the actors, especially when the reason for the title of the film is given, if it really is.\n",
      "This is a rip off of Bruce Almighty which is ten times more funnier; Salman Khan cannot act he is always screaming and making stupid faces while Priyanka Chopra is just as bad as Salman...Amitabh Bachan is okay taking over Morgan Freeman's role but the film is a complete copy of Bruce Almighthy and is very very bad.... <br /><br />This makes me wonder as Bollywood have excessive amounts of money in their grasps...why continue to make crap movies which are complete remakes and then deny the very fact that it is a remake.<br /><br />The Director should be banned as well as the producers...Can Bollywood not make any good films anymore?\n",
      "When a writer turns director plans to make a movie. What do you expect? At least an original story if not a perfect direction. But Mr. Rumi Jaffery shamelessly copies Bruce Almighty, adds some idiotic sequences of his own, throws few songs and here's what we get- a horrible copy of Bruce almighty. To add to the shame quotient, director denies it being a copy.<br /><br />If the director had blindly copied the almighty, the movie could have been at least watchable. The modified script has easily made this one of the worst flicks of this year. Less said about the star-cast, the better. Throw money on us, we'll do any crap you say. Come on Mr. Khan and Mr. Bachhan, You've achieved a lot in your career. At least pay attention to the scripts you choose.<br /><br />If India had Razzie, this one would have been a sure winner.\n",
      "If you are going to steal ideas, at least give credit to the original. Also, if you are going to copy, take your time and try to improve upon the original. Both, I guess, are too much to expect from typical Bollywood productions.<br /><br />As some of the other folks have already mentioned. This is a REMAKE of Bruce Almighty with the typical Bollywood masala. Overacting (come on, we are talking about Salman), weak script, weaker directing. Just to give you an example, I usually like Jaspal Yadav in movies. No matter how small his role is, he manages to make it funny. Not in this one. In an attempt in increase the running time of the movie, the director/script-writer added several additional characters which truly haven't added anything to this poor movie. <br /><br />Thank god for Priyanka though. God, tussi seriously great ho.<br /><br />Final verdict, if you love Bollywood movies no matter how bad they are, you will probably enjoy it. But, if you have any TASTE or care for quality, save your money and TIME.\n",
      "This movie is horrible. A really bad version of \"Bruce Almighty\".<br /><br />Salman is not a good actor. Maybe ten years ago he seemed somewhat appealing. But in every comedic role he plays now, he just seems to suck even more.<br /><br />Priyanka Chopra was never meant to be an actress. She's beautiful, but a big mistake was committed when someone out there thought that models could act. I think she should have just stayed a model. In every movie I have seen that stars her, I'm always disappointed.<br /><br />Sohail Khan? I didn't even know he was an actor until I saw this movie. He's even worse than his brother.<br /><br />I just don't understand why Amitabh Bachchan signs up to play these horrible roles in cheap movies. He's so spectacular. Why doesn't anyone give him a good role in a good movie?<br /><br />The soundtrack wasn't even nice. Rumi Jaffery, I think he didn't know what he was doing. Did he think that this movie was going to be good? I don't even know what kind of audience he aimed for.<br /><br />Just not one of my favorite movies.\n",
      "Salman's comedy films like HELLO BROTHER, MAINE PYAAR KYUN KIYAA are terrible But this film is even worse A remake of BRUCE ALMIGHTY, but a bad one It's boring and keeps getting worse First few reels between Salman- Priyanka and Salman- Anupam are as boring as ever and Salman's shouting worsens And if this isn't worse Enters Sohail Khan trying to do a Akshay in MSK and the film gets even worse, unbearable their scenes together are so bad, that you will surely get a headache the twist in the tale too seems illogical and the second half gets even more childish The lie detector is okay but the way the film ends it's even more stupid<br /><br />Rumi Jaffrey seems inspired by his mentor David Dhawan and follows his Style too much but sadly fails in handling the film Music is outdated SFX too is bad<br /><br />Performances are mediocre Salman is unbearable in first half, he shouts too much and his dial delivery is also bad, in second half he is better but sadly nothing even good enough Sohail is even worse, he is bad Priyanka Chopra doesn't have anything to do Dalip Tahil, Anupam Kher are average Amitabh seems to have walked out of a Rein and Taylor ad and just moves around with a know it all smile but his presence does uplift some scenes\n",
      "This mess just reminded me of one of those 70s pan European co-productions that were so prominent at the time. The characters inhabit a Disneyesque, sanitised version of 1920s Austria where everyone and everything is scrubbed shinily clean and everyone walks aboutwearing beautiful clothes. The story itself would be a good basis for adecent dramatic film but as soon as I heard the dreadful dubbed voice coming out of Heinz Hoenig's mouth I knew this was a stinker! Why does the film show Halsman alive and well in America in the 1950s spoiling any dramatic tension - we already know in the first 2 minutes of the film that he is going to be free, whats the point watching any further? (I personally didn't know who he was before watching the film) Why does Martine McCutcheon have to talk with that ridiculous American accent in a film set in Austria????????? All in all an unwatchable mess. Badly scripted, badly directed and badly acted. AVOID!!!!!!!!!\n",
      "Ah.. \"the place promised in our early days... \" - a phrase soaked in soft memories of naive, but blissful adolescence. Too bad the plot reads like that lame anniversary card you Dad gave your Mom last year. The animation is, of course, stellar - but the story? Well - let's see... what is a story anyway? What do clouds mean? Oh wait - if you're like me - who f***ing cares.<br /><br />After reading the \"helpful\" review on this, I gave this film a shot and watched it. I mean hey, I loved Spirited Away. It's not as though anime has to be along the lines of Fist Of The North Star for me to enjoy it. But oh my god, what a piece of s***! It's like one of those films where you keep thinking the plot is starting to get good, but it's not. In fact, the plot is \"tricking you\" into thinking it's going to get good, and then when you're interested again, it's like - \"hehehe... got you sucker...\", and then continues to unfold as lamely as you subconsciously assumed it would after the first 15 minutes.<br /><br />Nonetheless, out of respect for the talent it takes to make a finely animated film such as this - I have to give it far more than 1 star. But still, those 4 stars are for quality of workmanship alone, and NOT for an enjoyable film. But you don't have to take MY word for it... Go ahead, watch it. But I promise you, unless the question - \"What do clouds mean?\" appeals to you, then you will feel cheated out of the time you wasted watching this . Besides, you can always just go to the drugstore and read anniversary cards for free.\n",
      "For a movie that goes for 90 minutes to last my group of friends 120 minutes to watch one must think it's pretty awful.<br /><br />We paused the film many times to talk about what happened but still ended up finishing the movie with no clue.<br /><br />The story was very nicely written but was all over the place. For some reason Hokkaido had been taken over or something and a tower was built... Why??? don't ask me What happens??? I don't know... it was nice but not good,. I may be writing a critique about this film but it was so confusing do not know what to write about. It was just so hard...<br /><br />Watch it if you need to fall asleep.\n",
      "By the looks of things on the Anime Network, I actually thought that there would be an interesting story with this movie... scratch that theory.<br /><br />I finally got the chance to see this at my monthly Anime Club meeting, and I have never been so disappointed in my life! For starters, there's a war going on that sounds an awful lot like the Civil War all over again- except it's Japan and the US; not the Confederate States and the Union States.<br /><br />Secondly, the movie just moves so slowly.<br /><br />I know that that's normal in an anime you see first-hand, but the least you could hope for is for them to get to the next scene.<br /><br />Another thing that annoyed me were all the false endings: you had no idea when they'd finish the movie and when they do, it's a total cop-out! The girl wakes up, and the tower (along with a big chunk of the city) gets nuked! All anime fans, I cannot stress this enough: do not watch this movie! 0/10\n",
      "I've read quite a few good reviews on this movie and I just can't understand why. Now I know foreign horror films tend to have some very bad acting. (which this one does)And they pride themselves on being very atmospheric. (one of the few plusses with this movie) But why must they be so damn disjointed. It's like the editting is performed by someone having seizures. The movie is all over the place and totally incoherent. Maybe it's just me but most Italian horror flics seem to have the same problems. They make little sense. I bought this movie on sale and I was still robbed! SPOILER: The model airplane death scene has to be one of the lamest deaths I've ever witnessed! The old lady ought to be put in a home though the son was good for a few chuckles. The only really intense scene was the nun being killed by the scissors. And the ending.... doesn't exist!! What the hell is this movie about??? Terrible movie... avoid at any and all costs!!!\n",
      "Firstly let me say that I am an avid Horror Fan. I collect and love lots of different horror movies from the Italian gore to the more psychological to the plain funny as in Evil Dead. Now, Desecration. What category does this fall into? It maybe has its own unique category. If so, It would be close to the bottom of the pile...where movies you will only ever watch once and still regret doing so, live. To describe the general gist of this movie is quite simple. forget unbelievable surrealism, forget cerebral and beautiful haunting imagery. Try 'a collection of stereotypical horror movie clichés that are thrown together without ANY real sense of structure, meaning and above all no message and no story is forthcoming'.<br /><br />Even some of these people here praising the movie have admitted it seemed to be going nowhere at times or didn't make any sense. Of the other reviews there is one that stands out and praises this movie as if it is the best movie ever made.... It isn't hard to guess that the reviewer is a keen user of cannabis-Deduced by the nickname, If I am wrong shoot me! - and if I were to view this movie under the influence, I too would probably say 'Wow' 'amazing' 'freaky' etc etc etc. In the grim harshness of reality though (!?), this movie is a total TURKEY. If you are considering buying this trash...be warned, there are better things to spend your money on. Like a new Can opener or something. If you want a cheap alternative to this movie, get a collection of older movie trailers, put them on back to back so it lasts an hour or so, then sit and watch it whilst flicking different coloured lights on and off now and then with some old led Zep or pink floyd music on in the background- playing backwards of course. 0 out of 10\n",
      "Supernatural horror film about a young boy who's mother dies suddenly on his birthday. Years later a chain of events beginning with the death of a nun spirals him downward into the pit of hell. Mixed bag horror film that is has some really great images and a sense of things being really off that are under cut by a lack of budget (The death by model plane that starts everything is laughable as are some of the other deaths) and performances that aren't all there, with some of the cast seeming to have come from who ever was around that day. Its one of those films that almost works but falls just short so seems more like a missed opportunity then something you actually will want to sit through. To be fair those who don't mind trying films that don't work as a whole in order to see spooky imagery will want to give it ago for the bits that do work.\n",
      "I couldn't find one redeeming quality in this pretentious mess. The plot is nonexistent and the acting is atrocious. And then there's the imagery...Yes, clowns can be creepy. Here, they're not. It doesn't make any sense for them to be there; I know it's intended to be surreal, even absurdist, but it comes across as forced, trite, and clichéd. The dead nuns get redundant pretty quickly. And, as a couple other reviewers mentioned, the murderous toy airplane is totally laughable. Personally, I thought the flying scissors were pretty inane as well. I marked this as containing spoilers, but really, what is there to spoil? With no plot and no tension, there's nothing to give away. Don't waste your time on this; it's not even worth satisfying your curiosity. It's just dreck. 0 out of 10 stars.\n",
      "No wonder GEORGE SANDERS got tired of being cast as Simon Templar, here in \"The Saint in London\". Although filmed in London, it has almost no flavor of a bustling city in its screenplay which has him on the trail of a bunch of counterfeiters and looks as if it was filmed on the quick on some strictly low-budget sets. He has David BURNS as his valet and SALLY GRAY as his blonde love interest. Whenever the scene shifts to a car chase outdoors, the process photography is obvious.<br /><br />It's all very ordinary with the usual number of close escapes as The Saint leaves his calling card wherever he goes.<br /><br />Sanders looks young and in good shape but seems almost bored with his role--and in this case, it's understandable. What little plot there is holds almost no surprises and it's all over in a matter of 72 minutes. It has the look and feel of a sub-standard B-film and nothing more than routine story without a spark of imagination.\n",
      "This is not normally the kind of movie I watch. I rented this movie on the recommendation of some of the kitchen workers at the restaurant where I am a waitress. I should have known better. They said it was \"hilarious\", \"funny as s*#t\", among other \"outstanding\" comments. The only reason I sat through till the end was to wait for the funny parts that were NEVER forthcoming. I did feel that some of the portrayals of the customers were realistic. If people were to see this movie and feel the whole as an accurate portrayal of the waiting profession, which I hope normal people would have the sense to figure out is not the case, I would be out of a job. If you like stupid, mindless \"humor\", see this movie. I feel that it insults a profession that I happen to take very seriously and pride myself on. This movie was a waste of my time and money.\n",
      "This film is by one of the worst movies I have seen this year. It is so quick to play the slapstick, immature humor that it doesn't allow the humor to really build. It tries to follow in the same breath of the likes of \"Office Space\" and \"Clerks\", but it falls well short. I admit, I did chuckle here and there, but overall I was the only person in the theater laughing the least. I cannot recommend this film.<br /><br />I'm sure people who have worked in the restaurant business might be able to relate to this film more, though I have worked in the customer service business before and I know how it is to deal with difficult people. With \"Clerks\" and \"Office Space\", I was able to relate to the humor of the workplace because it was clever and smart. \"Waiting...\" does not take that approach and is one lame gag after the next. The writers of this film should have taken more time to mold the humor in this one.\n",
      "After watching this movie about a \"day in the life of a restaurant,\" I couldn't understand the high rating it gets on IMDb, but then I noticed that most of the reviewers are former wait-persons who identified with the over-the-top caricatures of the staff and customers of these restaurants.<br /><br />For anyone else it is just a bunch of crude high-school level gross-out jokes. <br /><br />I realize comedy is subjective, but I kept hoping that the energetic (and in some cases attractive) cast might actually be given some sort of comedic situational set-up for the jokes instead of a series of barely (pun intended) connected stoopid gags.\n",
      "When you sit down to watch a comedy that you think may have potential to be really genuine, hilarious, and have some crude adult humor thrown in beware, it may turn out to be a total stinker like \"Waiting...\". I thought the idea of the setting, an everyday boisterous steakhouse, and the comedy of Ryan Reynolds would make this a hit, but the film blows on every level. The plot is non-existent, there are no jokes, the single attempt at any comedy (I won't spoil it, as if I could spoil anything about this crapper) is beyond childish and is used over and over throughout this 90+ minute root canal. Stereotypical, lame, and stupid are just a few words that come to mind.<br /><br />Who voted this as a \"10\", children under 12 who snuck the DVD from their parents and watched it late at night while all were asleep??? Pleeeeeaaasseeeee!!!!! How do these scripts get through to be major films? Also, please, enough already with the huge overblown \"UNRATED\" DVD versions, so you added a 5 second scene and now the film is sooo much better than the crap fest that we saw in the theaters, all I can say is NO.\n",

Then, if they look at your worm, you shout \"fag!\" and playfully kick their ass. Note, the \"Unrated and Raw\" DVD shows squat.<br /><br />Stuff like spitting on food is about what you'd expect. The caricatures will be recognizable to anyone who has worked in a \"Shenaniganz\". The philosopher-dishwasher (Chi McBride as \"Bishop\") and tightly-wound waitress (Alanna Ubach as \"Naomi\") are made to order. Justin Long (as Dean) does all right with the best-written role.

      "What irked me the most about this film was the lack of attention to details, and what I consider an important one. The flags on the right shoulders of the uniforms were correctly worn \"backwards\" with the canton (field of stars) are in the top right corner instead of the left. Army regulations call for the flag \"to be worn so that to observers, it looks as if the flag is flying against a breeze.\" If a soldier was moving forward, the flag on the right shoulder would appear to be in motion. However if a flag is worn on the left shoulder, the canton should face left as it usually does. In this film some left shoulders had flags worn \"reverse\", which is just wrong. I've never had the honor of serving my country, but as an American I want our flag to be shown proper respect.\n",
      "After returning from a tour in Iraq, two soldiers attempt to track down their squad leader who has gone AWOL before something terrible happens. Based on some killings in Fort Bragg this is a a good but not great little film thats hurt by a directorial style that makes the film seem like any number of recent independent films. Some people have called it the Sundance look, which is a style of film making that some people adopt to get noticed at a film festival. I'm sure it helps to assure that their film gets seen because its the look that film festival organizers seem to like, but for me a member of the paying audience I find it more on the order of lacking in creativity. I would think it has less to do with Sundance and more to the fact that film schools are turning out filmmakers who are all clones cut with the same cookie cutter. Watch any number of independent films and you see that Garrison blends in with them seamlessly. Its a shame because the story is a good one, even if the pay off is announced at the opening. Recommended only for those who don't watch a large number of independent films.\n",
      "I've read prior comments concerning the character development, the musical score, and more good reasons to kill time with this movie.<br /><br />I heartily disagree.<br /><br />The music is good, but it's sometimes overwhelming and unnecessarily hard. The characters, apart from the investigating sergeant, are cardboard characters, deprived of intelligence. I found it really hard to care about any of them, and I was continuously hoping that they would all end up in freakish accidents. Even the newbies deserved to get it up the rear end. I especially consider here the staff sergeant who goes AWOL. This guy is giving orders, and he's a total basket case. If this is an accurate description of the American army, then by God, the world is in peril. The pace of the movie is slow, to say the least, the dialogues are simple (suitable for a redneck military audience), and did I mention that the characters are despicable?<br /><br />I suffered through the movie, and wish all the people who think this is good and realistic all the best. I fear a society where this is your standard drama, and I advise military leaders to also select their officers based on a psychological profile, and not only on the badass crazy percentage.\n",
      "This is by far the worst movie that I have ever seen. The DP must have been blind and the sound guy must have been wearing ear plugs. The film is a sad attempt at a low budget film. By the looks of it the film budget must have been $0. The actors suck and the editing is ridiculous. Filmmakers in San Antonio, Texas are really stupid to think that audiences will want to see such a horrible film. I have yet to see a decent movie from a \"San Antonio Filmmaker\". Someone needs to tell these people that their movies suck and that they need to stop making them NOW!!!! Just because you get your movie picked by a cheap distributor does not mean that the film is worse a damn!! I had to return the film an get my money back...that's how bad it was!!!\n",
      "Screenwriter Kevin Williamson had nothing to do with writing this sequel but even if he had I doubt if he would have been able to improve it much . The fundamental problem with SCREAM 3 is that we've seen it all before . There's a pre title credit sequence telephone conversation that climaxes in death and then we're on a set of a movie which eventually ends with cast members getting killed one by one . We know where everything is heading but the attempts to hold our attention are rather lame . For example one of the characters sees the masked killer coming towards and guess what ? It's a dream which is something that rings of pathetic story telling . We also get a cameo from Jay and Bob from the Kevin Smith movies which leaves a feeling of doubt that the producers we're getting a bit desperate in the gimmick department . The climax is somewhat watchable but is let down by the fact that Sidney probably didn't need saving after all and the finale was written just so the murderer could explain his motives . For a film franchise that shouts how clever and post modernist it tries to be the producers should know about the law of diminishing returns . Haven't they seen THE GODFATHER 3 ?\n",
      "Scream 3 just doesnt have the formula that the last two did,and what I mean by that is Scream 3 isnt scary,the same old thing happens,and worst of all,it isn't entertaining.(SPOILER)Like in this one,you would expect Cindy to die,but she dosent,she just survives again,which isn't fun to see.(ANOTHER SPOILER)I'm sure Wes Craven wanted to make something unpredictable,so he made the outcome of the movie unpredictable,but in a BAD way,because it was Cindy's brother all a long,that just doesnt fit,Its impossible for Cindy not to know that she's had a brother for so long.The only good part about the movie is that...uh...there is no good part about this movie actually.I do have to give credit to the acting,it was pretty good,but that dosent make up for a bad movie.Bad ending,a BIG lack of entertaiment make Scream 3 a terrible horror movie.I give it a 3/10.\n",

      "SPOILERS - READ WITH CAUTION<br /><br />While this movie claimed to not follow any rule, there was still one big general rule that really should have been followed - as pointed out by Randy Meeks (who makes an appearance via a recording filmed before his death), at the end of a trilogy, ALL BETS ARE OFF. A main character (a.k.a someone from the original) should die. There will be more blood, more gore, more excitement and a killer ending. This is no ordinary sequel. But of course, Scream 3 fails to fire in these areas.<br /><br />It doesn't match up to the first 2 with their wit, thrills and quality. What we get instead is a product that doesn't really excite and leaves the viewer yawning. The ending was far-fetched and in all honesty is rather stupid and had me shaking my head. <br /><br />Some moments were good. A variety of cameos were worth a smile and so was Jamie Kennedy's video recording. <br /><br />Overall, could of done better. 5/10<br /><br />\n",
      "I guess this movie was alright. I have always been a fan of the Scream series and I enjoyed this one. The writers put way too much humor into the movie though. They didn't keep a dark enough tone like they did in the first and second. Despite this it was still a good movie, entertaining, scary, creative, etc. It is a great way to end the wonderful horror series.\n",
      "They say that horror film series like these tend to deteriorate after the first film, and this is exactly what Scream does. After the magnificent opener, the above average sequel, we now have a lame third flick. I have many problems with this film.***SPOILERS AHEAD***<br /><br />*Randy is supposed to be dead. But they can't help sneaking him in anyway, on a prerecorded tape to explain \"the rules\".<br /><br />*While these rules are clearly spelled out- its the last movie,so anything can happen, and anyone can die, the movie proceeds to ignore them completely. I was waiting to see which of the main characters would die. But none of them did. Also, the killer is supposed to be almost superhuman because its the last film. But I seem to remember it being harder to kill the guys in Scream 1 than this guy.<br /><br />*The killer himself, is a minor character until the end, when he is revealed. You shouldn't have to think twice, and say \"Who?\" when the killer is revealed. (I thought they would have learned their lesson from Scream 2 about this one.)<br /><br />It's all to samey for my liking, although I did like the bit at the end, which pushed postmodernism to new extremes......I wonder if they'll get divorced too.\n",
      "I remember settling down in front of the TV on Monday nights, just waiting for that voice to introduce \"Monday Night Football\" - \"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, this is Howard Cosell.\" As this movie pointed out, Cosell in fact was \"Monday Night Football\" - without him, as was pointed out in this movie, you didn't have \"Monday Night Football,\" you had football on Monday night. \"Monday Night Mayhem\" is an expose type movie, showing us the mostly unsavoury events that went on behind the scenes: the tension in the broadcast booth, director Chet Forte's gambling problems and womanizing. Some of it was interesting, but I really didn't find most of this to be particularly engrossing.<br /><br />Perhaps the problem was John Turturro as Cosell. I'm almost tempted to let him off the hook. Who could really play Cosell - the look, the voice? But then again I've seen \"Ali\" and Jon Voight's uncanny ability to capture Cosell. Turturro just didn't do it. He never came across - to me at least - as Howard Cosell; he was always an actor trying to be Howard Cosell (and trying too hard at times in my opinion.) The same can be said for those portraying the rest of the on-air MNF cast. Kevin Anderson as Frank Gifford, Brad Beyer as Don Meredith, Chad Coleman as O.J. Simpson, Shuler Hensley as Keith Jackson - none of them seemed like the real thing. That just threw me off too much.<br /><br />I thought some of the insights into Cosell were interesting. Cosell comes across as surprisingly insecure, not just wanting the approval of his superiors (especially Roone Arledge, played by John Heard) but needing to be told that he has their approval. In an interesting balancing act, Cosell also comes across as arrogant - disdainful of his \"jock\" broadcast colleagues, and even of \"Monday Night Football\" itself, believing himself really more suited to more serious news reporting.<br /><br />There were some interesting aspects to this movie, but I never really thought it found its footing and it seemed to lack any real consistency. I'd call it a mediocre movie at best.<br /><br />4/10\n",
      "This was one of biggest wastes of 2 hours. I felt the film was poorly acted. My biggest problem was some of the inaccuracy of some of the games that were featured the wrong teams. I realize that I am big football fan, but how hard is it for the writers to do a little research on the games and particular teams involved that were played in the history of Monday Night Football?<br /><br />\n",
      "Occasionally interesting bio about a not-too-intelligent dancer called Isadora Duncan. If this film is anything to judge her by, then I would describe her as arrogant, stupid, self-delusional, self-obsessed, narcissistic, shallow, and slightly insane. (So pretty much like a certain actress involved in this.) The Russian poet she marries is a pathetic moron who looks like a clown. He shortly after commits suicide, a decision one might understand in view of the fact regarding his character and life.<br /><br />The movie is too long; it's not that it's badly made, but, rather, the problem is that the dance scenes are utterly dull, and that Duncan was neither a \"deep\" enough person, nor was her achievement anything to shout about (I mean she was just a dancer - big deal) - and a Communist on top of that. The high point of the movie is the last scene, in which she dies by getting strangled by her own clothes that get stuck on the wheel of a car she's in. A very good scene and very surprising. Like in a horror film.<br /><br />As for dancing, what a dumb activity that is. To quote a friend of mine: \"women must have invented all those ritualistic pair dancing routines which are designed to check if your testicles are small and warm enough for him to be with a woman forever\".<br /><br />Now to quote a dumb critic: \"Isabela was the the most prominent free-thinker of her time.\" So to sleep around and succumb to Marxism's imbecilic philosophy constitutes free thinking, huh?\n",
      "I love the Avengers. Emma Peel was a hero of my childhood. I was ridiculously excited for the arrival of this film and had nauseated all my friends when the project was first announced about who was to be our two spies. I was thrilled with the selection of Fiennes -- but Thurman? I was hesitant. Then Diana Rigg passed on being in the film. Another bad sign. Then, the television trailers, yet a third omen but I told myself the movie could not possibly be that bad. IT was worse than my wildest nightmares -- and I have an excellent imagination. Thurman was as bad as I thought, Fiennes had nothing to play to. Macnee, oh, how it could have improved if we'd seen him. I think this movie is terrible because they didn't get the joke. The Avengers is cheeky, campy, fun, and never without some form of the double entendre somewhere. Apparently, the script writes never actually saw the series and didn't get the joke. I beg, some British filmmaker somewhere give it a chance. Make your own version. Give some dignity back.\n",
      "This movie based on the popular British TV series is such a flop it doesn't really deserve comment, but here are a few nonetheless.<br /><br />This is the kind of movie making that really has you wonder if you should ever visit a theater again, when you consider the waste of millions of dollars on sets, special effects and high-powered actors that could have been used for such better causes (such as, oh, say a big-screen version of \"My Mother the Car\").<br /><br />At any rate, the film got what it deserved by being universally panned by critics and bombing at the box office. It was then rushed out of theaters with the bad-film strategy that relative obscurity would result in more bread at the video stores.<br /><br />Considering that Ralph Fiennes (Schindler's List, Englsh Patient) and Uma Thurman (Pulp Fiction, etc.) were at the top of their box-office draw potential, and with the addition of the always popular Sean Connery in a unique role as a villain, one would think that this movie would have been a sure hit. However, the potential went lightning fast down the tubes, greased by a stinky script, second-guessed editing and incompetent direction.<br /><br />The best elements of the original series, namely, its charm and style, are absent. A lot of the charm came from the relationship between Steed and Peel. But Fiennes' Steed is aloof and Thurman's Mrs. Peel is cold as ice. The two appear to be sleepwalking through their respective roles, with visions of fat paychecks dancing in their heads.<br /><br />Ironically, an imprudent element of the TV series that was indicative of its downhill slide after the departure of Diana Rigg (the original Mrs. Peel), namely, the introduction of the silly character of \"Mother,\" IS included in the film. Go figure.<br /><br />Connery 's performance as a mastermind who can manipulate the world's weather falls flat. Like Fiennes and Thurman, he appears to be going through the motions of a script he has no faith in.<br /><br />Quirky aspects of the original series that were cute and amusing have been replaced with gimmicks that are just unfunny strange and head-scratchingly bizarre. For example: the requisite cameo of an actor from the original series features only the voice of Patrick Macnee in the role of an invisible man behind a desk. What this character has to do with anything, other than adding to an already disjointed script, is anybody's guess.<br /><br />On a website competently dedicated to the series it has been speculated that the director never saw a single episode of the TV Avengers. If you were any kind of fan, you will immediately observe that there is a good reason to believe this. Jeremiah Chechik's direction seems to lack any instinct for the flavor of the original series.<br /><br />At any rate, with this brand of TV series-inspired movie making, you may find yourself yearning for \"Return to Gilligan's Island.\" Originally hyped as a summer blockbuster, the cinematic version of \"The Avengers\" is only spectacular in its capacity to disappoint.\n",
      "Is The Avengers a good film? No. Is it the worst film ever made? No. I first saw the movie at the cinema upon its release and, at that time, I did think that it was one of the worst films I'd seen up to that point. I've watched it 2 or 3 times since then and my opinion of it has improved, well, very slightly at any rate. Apart from a pervading incoherence, I think the film's major problem is its slightness; it's only an hour and a half long and the plot is very simplistic to say the least. It's not hard to imagine audiences feeling a bit short-changed when it first came out, especially as the film was a big-budget, would-be summer blockbuster. Another big problem is the casting of Uma Thurman as Emma Peel. Thurman has shown herself to be a fine actress in movies such as Pulp Fiction but she just looks out of her depth here (I never believed in her as a top-level scientist for a second) and her English accent doesn't sound natural. Nicole Kidman, to whom the role was first offered, would surely have been better, in particular, she's displayed flawless English accents in films such as The Others and The Hours. An English actress I also think would have made a great Peel is Joely Richardson but the studio would probably have vetoed such a choice on the grounds of her not being a big enough name. Ralph Fiennes was a real enigma in this film - there was nothing wrong in principle in casting him as Steed but he looks ill at ease throughout the movie as if he's rather be elsewhere. I can only assume he'd already twigged that the film was going to be a turkey. What's worse, Fiennes and Thurman have absolutely no chemistry between them, which wastes the snappy dialogue they have with each other throughout the film. The supporting cast fare a bit better with seasoned pros such as Sean Connery, Jim Broadbent and Fiona Shaw making the most of their underdeveloped parts. The retro-chic world of the original TV series is nicely recreated and there's no shortage of nice cars, costumes and locations but what's good about the film is easily drowned out by what's bad; The Avengers is ultimately a shallow, rushed and messy affair, severely hampered by the performances of its two leads. Handled properly, the film could have been a wonderful success for all concerned, the first chapter of an entertaining and lucrative franchise, stretching well beyond the 1990s; instead it's one of the most embarrassing flops of that decade. The original cut of the film was apparently two and a half hours long but, following negative reactions from audiences at test screenings, the studio hacked the film down to its present one and a half hour length. This doesn't actually come as much of a surprise as there is a lack of proper narrative flow to the film suggestive of chunks of explanatory scenes having been cut out. Just one example: towards the end of the film, just before they enter Sir August's underwater lair, Steed and Peel enter a phone box and Peel says \"how now brown cow?\" down the phone. The phrase seems to be a password to enter the premises but how does Peel know it? There's been talk here and there of the possibility of Warners releasing a director's cut or special edition DVD, restoring the original two and a half hour version. I think this would be a good idea and I'd definitely be interested in watching the full version of the film. It's highly unlikely to be any kind of masterpiece but it's difficult to imagine that it wouldn't improve upon the movie as it stands. At the very least you'd have to assume that it would be more coherent. Sadly I don't think the chances of Warners going down this line are high; I have the feeling that this is a movie the studio would rather forget about than draw attention to.\n",
      "Warner Bros. fantasies have always had a certain memorable flare. Dating back to films like \"Superman\" and \"Blade Runner\", a viewer could always be guaranteed at least a ticket into another world. \"The Avengers\" would have been that next \"big\" thing for Warner Bros. had it not been so shoddily edited at the last minute. It should be duly noted, however, that this film had all the signs of a thanksgiving turkey: It's release date, which was moved from late June to the dog days of August. Then the fact that no press screenings have been allowed for critics. No good can come of these prophecies.<br /><br />\"The Avengers\", which, at best, is a second rate version of the original \"Batman\" has all the features of your top blockbuster: A Big name or two, a plethora of explosions, and enough special-effects to put \"Godzilla\" to shame. The Plot follows the exploits of the legendary secret agents John Steed (Ralph Fiennes) and Emma Peel (Uma Thurman), as they do battle with a maniacal meteorologist (Sean Connery) who has intentions on controlling the world's weather. Simple enough. Or so one would have thought. It would appear that some 25 minutes (!) was excised from the film as a result of poor test screenings. As history has told, no good comes from test screenings. As a result, the film becomes so utterly confusing that the viewer would sooner give up, rather than be insulted by a film that insists on staying one step ahead of you at all times. Only potentially good films are butchered in an attempt to make the film more appealing to youngster's attention spans. But make no mistake about it, this film is certainly not for children. Perhaps the last half hour will provide enough enjoyable action (and it does, believe me!) to distract them, but up until then the film consists of awkward dialogue, inane action (Gigantic teddy bears, anyone?), and an uncomfortable overdose of strangeness.<br /><br />The cast, at one time, might have been game, but only once in a while does Ralph Fiennes even crack a smile. Thurman has apparently got the English accent down perfectly, but the only problem lies in the fact that she forgets to give a performance worth remembering. And last, but certainly not least, Sean Connery. Sadly, he doesn't even look like he wants to take over the world. Only once, in a mumbled rant, does he evoke some feelings of evil. That being said, \"The Avengers\" is a technical masterpiece. Providing the viewer with a universe of dazzling sets (that should at least be nominated for an oscar), imaginative visual effects, and beautiful costumes, one almost forgets that England doesn't look like this anymore. Unless of course, you live there. The score, composed by Joel McNeely proves to be one of the coolest scores ever produced. Inducing excitement, tension, and a little smoothness, provided by some nifty jazz notes. All of which the film is unable to do itself. For those who won't enjoy this film, it is mercifully brief. So brief to the point that it's strange. It jumps from a one hour section of the beginning to a half hour of climactic action that the viewer blinks and the movie might just be rolling into the credits. One can only hope for an improvement with a director's cut. Until then, this film should gain cult status before it makes it's way to video. Which I'm sure will be soon.<br /><br />Out Of Four - **\n",
      "Astoundingly predictable, dull and IQ deficient, THE AVENGERS is really not worth the swag of a rental. The script is lame, and it also doesn't help that the two leads possess no chemistry whatsoever. Ralph Fiennes could have just as well telephoned in his performance, and Uma Thurman probably harangued her agent for getting her this gig. The special effects were ok, but it doesn't take Fellini to figure why this tanked at the box office.<br /><br />Sean Connery portrays the atypical mad genius character, which has been around since the dawn of movies, itself. Sean takes the ball and runs with it, churning out one of the hammiest performances I've witnessed in quite some time. Absolutely merciless. Patrick Macnee has a rather lengthy cameo, as well.<br /><br />When one takes into account the talent involved, THE AVENGERS should have captured at least a little bit of the magic that graced the 1960's series. Alas, it proved the old adage correct: \"You can't turn back the clock.\"\n",
      "Uma Thurman has the unenviable distinction of appearing in the 90s' two biggest \"can't be that bad, surely?\" films. Like \"Batman and Robin\", The Avengers, through sheer will of its poor critical reception, compels one to see it. An unseen force taunts the innocent rental video store customer with a \"come on, you know you want to, you're dying to know if it's as bad as they say\".<br /><br />Of course, the Avengers, like Batman and Robin, IS every inch as bad as they say. 86 minutes (the anaemic \"plot\" can't even stretch to an hour and a half) of sheer, unerring tedium that beggars belief. Thurman is the most obvious target. Her English accent is about 90% successful to my ears, (she's certainly no Keanu or Dick Van Dyke in the fake Brit stakes), but this notably draws on her acting. But the main flaw is her innate lack of irony. She just doesn't appear to comprehend such an old style of wit (not that such a misinterpretation is hard, as limply presented as it is here), and whereas in the delightful Pulp Fiction she amuses with her tales of Tony \"Rocky Horror\" and being the humour element of \"Fox Force Five\", as Mrs. Peel she's a washout.<br /><br />Many people cite the film's failure as a direct comparison to the television series. Whereas I understand enough of the show to know the real Mrs. Peel was too much of a lady to kick Eddie Izzard where it hurts, I've never really been acquainted with the 60s exploits of Patrick Macnee and co for it to really matter. To this end, I believe this gives me a fresh advantage in viewing the movie. I came to The Avengers without having to compare Fiennes' charm to that of Patrick's, or compare Thurman's curves to the incomparable cheekbones of Diana Rigg. It matters not. As good as the tv show, better, worse, the end result is the same: the movie stinks.<br /><br />Never on celluloid has there been such a resounding lack of chemistry between two leads. Even Thurman's scripted interruptions and witty rejoinders come too late, with Fiennes, sparkling in \"Strange Days\", excruciatingly self-conscious in Steed's shoes. Wilfully eccentric and forcefully quaint, their mannerisms are more poseur than debonair. These are two people that wouldn't even pass the time of day in real life, much less conduct a sexual relationship with chaste closed lips. Half the time it's almost impossible to believe they were in the same room during their scenes together, so weak is their connection.<br /><br />A slight upturn in the film is Sean Connery, who must have owed his agent a favour to have accepted this appallingly scripted farrago. As with his James Bond (to which the Bassey-soundalike Grace Jones end song owes a tip of the hat), Connery has an air of physical menace. And, as with the quote of this review, given half a chance Sean can make even the most innocent of lines sound dirty. He was actually talking about rain. Most of the time, though, he spouts about wanting a ransom in exchange for decent weather in England (like English people are so used to decent weather rain and snow would bother them - has the writer ever set foot in this country???) and tries to drug-rape Mrs. Peel in a distasteful scene. The rest of his lines are as inept as \"John Steed... what a horse's a**e of a name\", yet he manages to hold some modicum of dignity dressed as a giant teddy bear.<br /><br />In all honesty I can see no way, no level on which this film works. Direction in terms of shots and angles is reasonable, but in terms of actors it's lousy. The script is trite and thin. I really can't bring myself to describe the storyline as a collection of set pieces, as the term \"set piece\" generally implies something good. Whereas even the execrable \"Batman and Robin\" had some good bits threaded together, none of the painfully set-up \"segments\" that make up this inanity carry any form of tension, drama or wit. Believe me, this film truly is as bad as they say. I saw this film so you don't have to. Thank me for it, hate me for it, reward me for it. Just do me a favour and don't bother to see it.\n",
      "I wasn't all that interested in watching this movie, but I decided to anyway since it was one of the only ones that week there that I hadn't seen yet. I should've saw one of the others. I don't even remember what they are now, but it doesn't matter. I am pretty sure that THE AVENGERS is the worst movie of the decade and one of my least favorite movies of all time.<br /><br />John Steed (Ralph Fiennes) and Emma Peel (Uma Thurman) team up to stop Sir August de Wynter (Sean Connery) from destroying the planet with a weather-changing machine. I won't go into the plot too deeply, because it's just plain stupid.<br /><br />The acting in this movie was not very good. Ralph Fiennes and Fiona Shaw (Father) play two of the most annoying characters in any movies that I have ever seen. The constant unwitty one-liners between Fiennes and Thurman is very annoying. Sean Connery is at his worst here. I was disappointed in him, because he is a great actor who doesn't belong in this movie. Sir August de Wynter? Just the name of the character alone should tell you much.<br /><br />There was, however, one thing that was good about this movie. That would be Uma Thurman in her tight leather. I am absolutely in love with Uma Thurman, and I don't think she belonged in this film, but I am pretty sure seeing her wearing those catsuits were the only thing that kept me from having to eat my own legs and drink my own urine to survive this movie.<br /><br />Maybe you'll think I'm exaggerating a bit, but I found this movie to be boring and annoying. I recommend that it be avoided at all costs.\n",
      "With a cast that includes Connery and Thurman, how could you possibly go wrong? Watch this movie and you will find out. Painful to watch...it's a shame that one of the greatest of all time, Connery, got himself involved in such a disaster.\n",
      "yet another example of hollywood being totally out touch with how to make GOOD movies. and yet another example of an editing team/studio thinking they can cut and chop a movie to make it something it wasn't intended to be (a boring art house flick, not an action movie). Uma Thurman looks fantastic in dual roles, but she along with everyone else, looks lost and confused as to what they're supposed to do with these characters. ralph fiennes was laughably bad and Sean Connery finally gave his first truly horrible performance.<br /><br />i don't totally feel they are to blame though. the blame should be dumped on the director, editor and studio. how stuff like this gets past quality control is beyond me.<br /><br />if you want to check out Uma's amazing body (which is the ONLY reason i rented it) then go ahead. but when you get the worst migraine you've ever had trying to comprehend why you sat through this pile of dung, you have noone to blame but yourself.<br /><br />\n",
      "When the word gets out before the release of a movie or TV show that it's a real bomb, a snowball effect begins. Critics tend to jump on the (negative) bandwagon, the public gets an image stamped on its consciousness and the \"bomb\" label is like a self-fulfilling prophecy. This happened with the movie version of 'The Avengers.' It turns out the label is deserved, but maybe for different reasons than one might think.<br /><br />'The Avengers' doesn't suffer from a stupid script or embarrassing bad acting. Whoever put this movie together bent over backward to make sure that every shot in the film and every line of dialog spoken was something that could have come from the British TV series of the '60's on which it is based. And much of it could get a seal of approval as far as authenticity goes. Except one gets the distinct feeling that love isn't behind this movie, but rather money. Things may look and sound like the old TV show, but this coldly calculated production totally fails to capture its spirit.<br /><br />Even though John Steed and Emma Peel are supposed to be meeting for the first time as this picture begins, it is assumed that we viewers know the characters and everything about them already, so the action begins without any delay. Consequently, fifteen minutes into the movie, one feels like they've missed the first hour of the film. Also, one never gets involved in the convoluted plot and never develops any affinity for the characters. Plus, the film is given an obligatory 'Thunderball'-style ending done 1998 style. The old TV show never relied much on things blowing up and this addition here is no improvement.<br /><br />In this context it's absolutely impossible for new actors to succeed in the roles of Steed and Mrs. Peel. Whether Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman are doing a good job or not is not easy to tell and irrelevant anyway in this by-the-numbers production. They and Sean Connery (as villain Sir August de Wynter) are merely cyphers in this movie, and when could you ever have said that before about Connery, even if he does wear a bear suit? The one positive thing I can say is that Uma Thurman looks absolutely gorgeous as Mrs. Peel.\n",
      "This movie must have never been layed out to see if any of the scenes made sense. The script left much to be desired and the acting was bad. I have to say i'm disappointed in Sean Connery. If you've seen it, you know what i mean about teddy bears. If you ever want to know what a truly poor movie is like, see The Avengers.\n",
      "As a once regular viewer of MST3K I have to say this is not even close to being the worst file ever made. It is however one of the worst feature films in reset memory. It is to, borrow a word from another review, very \"Talky\". This wouldn't be bad if the dialog and charterers where better, but these are both action move grade. It's kind of like watching the charterer from Godzilla in The Godfather, with a plot the makes little sense on top. Overall the plot makes little sense, there not much action, despite this being marketed as an action move, the tempo is slow and boring and the move is hard to follow and and not worth following. The only good points, the cinematography and, best of all, it's only an hour and a half..\n",
      "This film makes no sense at all. I gave it a 2 because the actors did not phone in their parts; but a 2 is a gift.<br /><br />Unless you want something really really bad to view -- so that you know just where the bottom of the pile is, please don't rent this film. Rent (or buy) instead the videos of the Television series.<br /><br />What were the writers thinking?\n",
      "The Avengers is without a doubt one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I do not think I have ever been so bored with a film only an hour-and-a-half long. Neither Fiennes or Thurman capture their characters like MacNee and Rigg did in the original series. They rather spend the whole film throwing mindless banter at each other in order to see whom is the colder of the two.<br /><br />Sean Connery could do no right in this film. I wish he had been smarter and stayed away from this project the moment he read the script. The scene with the teddy bears will forever register in my mind right up there with the fight with Robert Shaw in \"From Russia With Love\" or the laser scene with Gert Frobe in \"Goldfinger.\" Why Mr. Connery? Why?<br /><br />One can fully understand why Warner Bros. went through such length to keep this film from being seen by critics before it was fully released. The script is awful, the characters uninteresting and the finale laughable. After all, no one in their right mind gave a damn as to whether Sir de Winter actually did control the world's weather. I'm sure all the armies in world wouldn't stand a chance against a very sensitive machine. Yeah, right.<br /><br />This movie stands no chance of getting any kind of recommendation.<br /><br />3/10 stars.\n",
      "I can't believe anyone can spend one penny to produce this... thing. This... thing has good things: some nice visual (and some means maybe two) and some (maybe three or four) witty lines. And the witty lines are abused going further... Things that are missing: the script (unlikely, offbalance), the characters (superficial, two-dimensioned), the direction (an ethilist baboon could do better).<br /><br />Incredibly, you start being bored after just ten minutes, as the first of many endless dialogues flows quietly.<br /><br />Shortly, I strongly recommend that you carefully avoid this movie. It is not worth the price, and it is not worth for free, because it is deadly boring.\n",
      "...this is like watching some movie from Yugoslav era, it gave me eeries. Same plot as always when it comes to Yugoslav film school-everything begins with funny plot and everyone think it will end funny, too. But for people from ex-YU it is always predictable-IT HAS TO END WITH A TRAGEDY. That is how all movies from ex-Yugoslavia end. That is how ex-Yugoslavia ended its existence. Also this movie is not Croatian only, unfortunately, it is Croatian-Bosnian-Serbian-Macedonian-Albanian production. Actors did their job excellent, three main male characters were superb, female role is a little bit pale and unconvincing to any foreign viewers. Rajko Grlic did an excellent job with \"Stefica Cvek-U raljama zivota\", I think he should stick to urban sophisticated stories as Stefica was.\n",
      "I've never enjoyed movie-making by a committee.<br /><br />\"Karaula\" is a cinematic equivalent of those 1980s hammy pop-folk-rock-whatever-happens-to-be-selling-at-the-moment-that is-what-we-play Bijelo dugme clones (Merlin, Hari Mata Hari, Valentino, Plavi orkestar, Divlje jagode, Regina) - a populist, don't-you-dare-go-deeper-than-the-outer-layer, watchable but ultimately quickly forgettable experience.<br /><br />It has identified a pretty wide group as its target audience and panders to it relentlessly in the most general sense possible. From the folksy screenplay full of snappy, and unfortunately often corny one-liners right down to the Halid Beslic cameo, \"Karaula\" plays like a checklist of movie devices and stock characters that have gone over well in the cinema(s) of former Yugoslavia throughout the last two decades: <br /><br />1. Goran Bregovic music score. CHECK! (And also some Sanja Ilic added for good ethno-mood measure.) <br /><br />2. Adolescent men of different (yugo)Slav nationalities spouting cheesy jokes. CHECK! (In \"Karaula\" they're, of course, led by a wise-crackin' Belgrade bad boy and his constantly smiling Dalmatian tag-along buddy - all of which seems lifted straight from that 'Bolji zivot' episode when Boba (Dragan Bjelogrlic) goes to the army and is entrusted with forming a multi-ethnic band.) <br /><br />3. Zany supporting character with a portmanteau-like nickname and a weird hobby. CHECK! (Enter botanically-obsessed colonel Rade Orhideja who follows in the long line of Mile Rent-A-Bubregs and Bili Pitons. Unfortunately he's not nearly as funny or as memorable. According to bloggers, obviously bored out of their skull, the character of Rade O. might've been inspired by Ratko Mladic who also served in Macedonia during the late 1980s and apparently also loved flowers - all of which I guess is the closest this unremarkable film will come to generating any kind of post-viewing discussion.) <br /><br />4. Lots of crass, unrefined sex scenes, used either for comic relief or as prelude to something tragic. CHECK! (Bascially any number of Yugoslav movies use both, but unfortunately unlike in, off the top of my head, \"Ko to Tamo Peva or \"Lepota Poroka\" where sex is skilfully woven into the story, \"Karaula\" uses it for nothing more than cheap thrills.) <br /><br />5. An out of the blue prominent (turbo)folk star cameo. CHECK! (Though \"Karaula\" seems to be presenting Halid Beslic with an ironic distance, his appearance is essentially no different from \"Tesna Koza\" or \"Zikina Dinastija\" stopping the plot for 2 minutes so that Brena, Sneki, Zorica Brunclik or whomever can sing their little song. Unlike \"Karaula\" those movies are at least honest about being populist crap.) <br /><br />In summary, I really have nothing apriori against usage of any of the above as movie devices, but \"Karaula\" simply misses the target on all of them - and misses it badly.<br /><br />The one bright spot is Emir Hadzihafizbegovic in the role of ST-diseased lieutenant. Trifunovic and the Croatian kid aren't bad either, it's just too bad both of their characters are written so sketchily and incoherently. This is especially true of Trifunovic's Ljuba who suddenly goes from a friendly simpatico smart-ass to a raging sociopathic monster within like a day with absolutely no proper justification in the script or plot.\n",
      "This movie is complete waste of time. Yup. Why? Oh, boy, where should I start? Bad acting? Lousy screenplay? Fact that movie is to late? <br /><br />Emir Hadziwhateverhisnameisić hated this role, he admitted it in some news interview, and that can be easily seen trough this entire move. I even felt sorry for him seeing how much he suffers acting in this movie. I doubt he faked his drinking... He is talented actor, but not even his talent couldn't make him even to try to act. I don't blame him. Sergej Trifunović is giving his best. Which means that he suck. Yup, Emir at least has talent, this poor sob doesn't... Only possible explanation why would anyone even consider him for (any) role is fact that he look like what other ex-YU nations see as a stereotypical Serb. Funny enough, Serbs see him as stereotypical Albanian... Toni Gojanović... is chosen for this role simply because he's Croat... Croatia have much better actors than him (is he an actor at all?), but he does seems to be trying, and since he's a \"newb\", we can look trough his fingers...<br /><br />Now, take a better look... Bosniak, Serb and Croat... and voilà, you have a generic ex-YU wannabe comedy... and that's it. It tries to look at war and reasons for war trough comedy but it just fail... there is no deep background story, there is no secret agendas, there is no comedy there is no nothing.. Movie was heavily advertised here as \"Movie that put together Serbs, Croats and Bosniaks in hilarious comedy\" and people wanted to see trough Karaula their youths and lives in pre-1991. Yugoslavia, but most of them abandoned theater before end because they have found foreign country and foreign army with foreign people and foreign stories. Something they didn't wanted or cared to see. Macedonia is foreign to Serbs, YPA is foreign to Serbs, Bosniaks and Croats are foreign to Serbs. Famous scene at the end of movie where actors get out on stage and public isn't tapping is clear sign what public thinks about this movie. <br /><br />I thought that pathetic ex-YU ethnic humor has died in 1991. And it did. This is just zombiefied version if it, and it's not funny. It's sad. Strange thing I find is the fact that only in Serbia this movie was advertised like this is 1975, like we all live in perfect \"brotherhood and unity\" and that war never happened. Film had financial success in all countries of former YU, except in Serbia, despite big advertising campaign. Movie entered trough big doors, but it exited through back door, quietly and shamefully. This movie is wanting to look back at last moments of Yugoslavia, it is trying to say to us that it's not our fault, that we all were seduced by \"drunken and selfish\" leaders, blah, blah, blah... It could make some point if it was released during 1995; 1996; or 1997; considering that war and Yugoslavia were still \"fresh\" and all... but in 2006, this movie just doesn't make sense... <br /><br />Legacy of this movie is big. Yup, before this movie, many various EX-YU actors and directors were talking about making some new movies as homage to old partisan films... luckily, this movie showed that it would be just waste of money...<br /><br />I want my 94 minutes back.\n",
      "after 15 years of painful waiting period for the new Real Rajko Grlic's movie, I saw Karaula last night and I was so sad and disappointed... The movie is not solid, it is to short and the energy and emotions are not distributed so well that we could feel and recognize that this is Grlic's movie... Story is nice, maybe even good, and out of this story he could not make a better movie... Sorry, either the time is changing all of us either there is something else... and also, some of the symbolic is so... well, political. with the clear political message, that was surely not expected from someone like Rajko Grlic... Anyway, I will always love his movies made before 1991.\n",
      "This film is one of the worst melodramas I have ever seen. The plot is witless and contrived, the songs are boring and the acting is wooden. Just when you think it couldn't get any worse, some ridiculous plot twist comes flying in from the clouds. <br /><br />I am no fan of Salman Khan and while I am still willing to give Ash a chance, this film is the sort of junk that gave her a bad reputation in the first place.<br /><br />I will say, however, that the photography and sound were good, so it wasn't completely painful to watch. It's only bad when you pay attention to the actors or the script.<br /><br />You have better things to do with your time, believe me.\n",
      "The second half of Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam is loosely inspired by the 1983 Naseeruddin- Padmini- Anil Kapoor film \"Woh 7 Din\" which itself was a remake of a South Indian Film.<br /><br />The first half's plot is from Maitrayi Devi's Bengali novel \"Na Hanyate\" (English translation: It does not die) which was written in response to world-renowned scholar Mircea Eliade's semi-autobiographical novel \"Bengal Nights\". There are several resemblances, including the 'mirchi-eating' incident, which suggest that they are more than uncanny resemblances.<br /><br />There are numerous films in several languages which have been based on literary works. There is nothing inherently wrong in that, except that in this case, Bhansali has not acknowledged the 'right' source of his work. We have heard that HDDCS has been based on a script told to him by one of his Gujarati fans. Really, Mr Bhansali? Or is it a case of acting naive and passing the responsibility of plagiarism to your Gujarati fan when one finds out?\n",
      "Disappointing. The basically vapid plot butchered what could have been an interesting idea. The film seems to rely excessively on the appeal of Aishwarya and Salman to conceal the fundamental flaws of bad acting, toilet humor, and cheesy songs. In addition, some of the sets were clearly faked. Now, I know Bollywood, and I would have been willing to put up with some cheesiness and inconsistencies if I saw occasional good acting and at least one catchy tune. Right off the bat, all I saw was Aishwarya giggling and acting like a dumb little pretty face, which is SO not what I expect from her. Salman's acting, emotions, and lip-synching seem utterly contrived and lifeless. Shah Rukh Khan is so much better and so much more emotionally charged! If you are a newcomer to Indian films, like me, go rent \"Devdas\" or \"Kal Ho Naa Ho\" instead. Maybe I have Western tastes or whatever, but I've seen a lot of corny musicals in my time, and liked most of them. This was the bottom of the barrel, and I can hardly believe that that Bhansali went on to make \"Devdas\" after producing this cheap masala movie. PS I am a fourth generation Italian American. Salman's scene where he makes up a stupid \"Italian\" custom downright enraged me. Was it the director's intent to B.S. this way?? I feel I am being generous by giving this film four stars.\n",
      "A good premise ruined by a simplistic, soap-opera script, weak supporting performances (though Angelina Jolie is, as has been noted, quite good), and low production values, this story of the lives of women helping to settle the West never quite gels. Dana Delaney tries hard to hold it together, but it just doesn't work. The film's habit of sledghammering home whatever points it's trying to make doesn't help much, either. A little subtlety would have been far more effective, along with a more coherent story and characters who were a little less cardboard. Most historians agree that the \"taming\" of the west occurred when women began arriving in greater numbers--before then, men of the region spent the majority of their time getting drunk and killing each other and the Indians--and someday that would make a really good movie. Not this time, though.\n",
      "I was going to write an interpretation, but any interpretation will be unconvincing because the movie was so completely ambiguous. Ambiguity is the only possible result when you mix symbolism with an almost complete lack of dialogue.<br /><br />Now I don't have a problem with ambiguity per se. That's exactly what I like about some David Lynch films, that they're left open to interpretation and the best argument wins. The difference here is presentation. With movies like this, it doesn't matter how profound the underlying theme is if said theme is presented in a boring uninteresting way. Every single scene in the movie is shown, the point is made, and then the scene continues for some reason. These scenes go on and on with no dialogue, no music, no camera movement, and not even enough light to allow you to entertain yourself with the backgrounds.<br /><br />Some of this structurally unnecessary prolonging is done in an attempt at realism. Though it seems naive to assume that real life boredom will be film-worthy simply because it is real. Other times the prolonged scene is simply an immature attempt to make the audience uncomfortable. For example, scenes eating with prominent chewing noises, the tourist and her lesbianism, mother and her masturbation, and so forth.<br /><br />I just figured out the best interpretation: By being aware of time, life slows tremendously and becomes excruciatingly boring, as this movie illustrates beautifully!\n",
      "It wasn't a bad film. Not by any means. It was very well crafted, beautifully filmed, and managed to impart a powerful mood with artistry and precision.<br /><br /> Now, I'm not a lightweight about slow-moving films. But after an hour of this film I was about to chew my own leg off to try and escape. You reach this point where you see the female lead step on one end of a LOOONG escalator, and you think to yourself, \"I'm going to have to watch her go the length of that whole damn escalator, aren't I?\" And yes, yes, you do.\n",
      "The only place this film can take you is 90 minutes closer to death. A complete waste of TIME. I can't believe anyone gleaned an iota of entertainment value from this boring, dismal, putrid movie. Plodding, plot less, devoid of drama and human interest, there is no excuse to waste the energy even to go to the store and rent it. Avoid at all costs! <br /><br />I didn't care about any of the characters or what happened to them. I found every situation completely implausible--even from a surrealist standpoint. It was maddening to sit through scene after scene of incomprehensible stupidity, waiting for something to happen, only to get to the end and realize NOTHING WAS EVER GOING TO HAPPEN!\n",
      "The film adopted a minimalistic approach, which means there are very little conversation, no grand stage-setup, and unfortunately, no story. Honestly speaking, I did not understand the film. The story itself is not plausible. It says that a watch seller sold a watch to a woman who would go to Paris. After that, the watch seller would adjust all the clocks he sees to the Paris time. The watch seller's mother went crazy because her husband died. The woman who went to Paris felt lonely and slept with another woman. That's absolutely all I could get from story, if there were any story at all. The three subplots did not link with each other, they were so scattered and they did not make any sense, either individually or collectively.<br /><br />There were occasionally one or two funny scenes, where all the viewers bursted out laughing. Still, this does not make a boring film good. This film cold be compressed into half an hour, if the shots were not so long.<br /><br />For the two hours that I watched the film, I felt extremely bored. I can't wait for the film to finish! I must say I do not know what is so artistic about this film. Maybe I don't know how to appreciate this kind of approach of making a film.\n",
      "<br /><br />Ugh.<br /><br />This is one of the least good movies I've seen in a long time, and I've seen some really bad ones. This one, however, is bad in a rather different way. This is the \"story\" of a guy who sells a girl his watch and somehow feels connected to her as she leaves for Paris. He goes around setting clocks to Paris time. He... oh wait, that's pretty much all he does in terms of thinking about her. I thought this was some huge romantic thing? As for her... she barely thinks about him, but I guess maybe she does though all we ever see is her doing random things in Paris with other people. Nearly every scene was too slow. I realize the movie is supposed to be about time, but if you want to make the point that cutting from one scene to another leaves out all the slow time in the middle, fine, but DON'T do it for the whole movie. I nearly wanted to cry after the first 15 minutes (and 2 scenes).<br /><br />The only halfway decent part of this movie is the performance by Yi-Ching Lu as the boy's mother, who is greiving over her husband's death in many real and interesting ways, which leads to a few very poignant scenes. Unfortunately, there were far too many scenes without her in it, and it got aggravating.\n",
      "An American businessman wants to build a hotel on a remote island, so he has someone sail him and his girlfriend there to check it out. The zombie scenes seem tacked on as an afterthought, so as a horror film this doesn't really work that well. However due to the ridiculous dialog and the hardcore sex scenes the film MIGHT be worth it for drunken party type viewing, but even that is stretching it (pardon the pun) Feel free to skip this one, as it's only remote interesting as a curiosity. That being said the way champagne is uncorked in the film is ingenious.<br /><br />Eye Candy: more than you can shake a decaying limb at <br /><br />My Grade: D <br /><br />DVD Extras: 27 minutes of Alternate footage; Production stills & Laura Gemser stills gallery; X-rated Trailer; and trailers for \"Zombi 2\", \"Emanuelle And The Last Cannibals\", \"Nightmares Come at Night\", & \"Slaughter Hotel\" <br /><br />Easter Egg: In the main menu, highlight scene access and press down to get to a hidden skull, click on it for the French opening credits\n",
      "No, there are no zombies having sex in this film, the zombies just do what zombies normally do...wander slowly and aimlessly and munch on human flesh. It's the living that have all the sex in this movie & boy is there lots....way too much for my taste & all pretty graphic, nothing left to the imagination. Hardly what I'd call erotic. Seems that there's a rich American developer that wants to build a hotel on a remote island, and he hires a guy with a boat to take him and his recent acquisition (Laura Gemser) to this place. The island is supposedly deserted but it seems that an old man lives there with his granddaughter, who may or may not be among the living herself. Of course the zombies get riled and walk, and munch. The best parts of this are filmed on the island, before that it's almost all extremely long sex scenes which get rather boring. There is a bright spot though in what appears to be a young Filipino woman who performs a strip-tease in an empty nightclub for our ship's captain, and she opens a bottle of champagne using her enormous...uh...talent. A very sleazy movie & of perhaps minor interest to horror fans. 4 out of 10.\n",
      "Well this is a real mess of a film. It's worthy of watching at a drive-in, where you don't have to pay much attention to the plot because you are too busy ... doing other things. Watch it on DVD, however, like I did, and you'll be in for a real miserable time.<br /><br />Others have described the plot so I won't comment on that. The script is pure garbage. It makes little sense. I'm convinced the director fused two entirely different movies together, one a bad porn, one an even worse horror film. The fusing together of two different movies, like in \"Dr. Butcher, M.D.\" can be a good thing, but in this case, it just doesn't work. Camera-work, direction, acting all run the gamut of bad to awful. Watch Fulci's \"Zombi 2\" and any other Laura Gemser movie instead of this dreck.\n",
      "(aka: EROTIC NIGHTS OF THE LIVING DEAD)<br /><br />Just saw the un-cut, newly-remastered Shriek/Media Blasters DVD of this and I must say, I was bored by the whole thing. However, 'everybody else' must have liked it because the cast stuck around for D'Amato's next Caribbean offering, PORNO HOLOCAUST (1981)<br /><br />OK, I admit I was turned on by the hardcore threesome between Manlio Cersosimo and the two Dominican whores he had up in his room, but the rest of the film was totally un-interesting, horror-wise or sex-wise. Gemser should have continued played Emmanuelle and I'm surprised she didn't here. Especially for a Joe D'Amato movie. <br /><br />There's surprisingly little gore for a film of this scope, and the zombie plot looks like it was thrown in there as a pretext for the soft-core lesbian scenes between Gemser and Funari. There's also soft core sex scenes between Eastman and Gemser and between Cersosimo and Funari as well as the previously mentioned hard-core sex scene.<br /><br />Plot concerns George Eastman taking Manlio Cersosimo and his girlfriend (Dirce Funari) to an island so he can scout locations for a new hotel resort. A female spirit (Laura Gemser) and an old man conjure up the dead buried on the island to go after these three and stop any development from taking place. <br /><br />Some of the zombies get impaled on sticks by Eastman and some brown & green stuff (blood?) comes flowing out, and there's a couple of zombies who get torched, but that's pretty much all the action. Eastman and Funari wind up in a 'mental institution' after all this. <br /><br />Shriek/Media Blasters did their usual, impeccable wide-screen treatment of this DVD, far more than the actual film deserves. Not much in the line of extras, though. There's also a half-way decent electronic score by Marcello Giombini. <br /><br />Mostly deserves a yawn...<br /><br />3 out of 10\n",
      "A hardcore sex/horror flick from Joe D'amato, Erotic Nights of the Living Dead was made back-to-back with the director's other zombie shagathon Porno Holocaust (released in 1981), and shares much of that film's cast, plus its island location. It also shares its ability to bore me witless, with the quantity and quality of sex seriously waning after the first half an hour, and very little in the way of decent gore, despite featuring more of the undead.<br /><br />D'amato regular George 'Anthropophagus' Eastman plays Larry, a sailor hired by mustachioed architect/stud John Wilson (Mark Shannon) to take him (and his current woman) to a mysterious island, which, according to local legend, is home to flesh-eating zombies which are ruled over by a cat. Once there, they meet a strange old man and his beautiful daughter (Laura Gemser), have sex, and run into lots of mouldy reanimated corpses.<br /><br />As you've probably surmised, it doesn't make whole lot of sense, and, at 112 minutes (in its uncut form), is extremely tedious. As always Eastman stays well clear of any hardcore action, preferring to keep his trousers on during sex, whilst Gemser indulges in purely soft-core fumblings. And all of the humping is strictly between the living (unlike Porno Holocaust, which featured a very randy zombie).<br /><br />Very occasionally, the film offers those seeking sleazy treats something to make them smilea woman displays a unique way of removing a cork from a champagne bottle, and Gemser bites off Wilson's todgerbut, on the whole, Erotic Nights of the Living Dead is a dreary mess.\n",
      "Porn! I love porn with every fibre of my being. Pornography has undoubtedly been one of the greatest influences in my life. Zombies! Zombies are just cool. Terrifying yet they command your empathy. A slow relentless scourge that forces man to look in the mirror and face his demons. Or because they eat brains. Whatever. So naturally you combine these two extremely cool genres you're bound to have something worth watching, right? Nearly. This film is a mess. Two guys and a girl go to the forbidden Cat Island (oooooo, spooky name) as the superbly mustachioed property developer (who earlier gets nasty with two ho's) wants to erect (pun intended) a hotel there. Of course there is a mysterious girl and old man on the island, and zombies. What are they doing there? Who knows? Who cares? Sex scenes scattered throughout the whole movie. Plenty of nudity for the perverts. I was disappointed there is only one porn scene, would've been great to see Laura Gemser get in on the action!!!!\n",

Please do yourself a favor, and don't bother watching this.<br /><br />Unless you enjoy intolerably bad movies, your time is better spent anywhere else. <br /><br />And I do mean ANYWHERE.<br /><br />It is hard to believe that any of these actors who participated in this movie did not get banned from the business permanently.

      "I actually found this DVD in supermarket basket full of discount products. 3,50 is not much, especially when it's says: The most funniest comedy since \"There's something about Mary\" starring: Ben Stiller, Janeane Garofalo, Mike Meyers, Alanna Ubach and many others... Alanna Ubach is the hot number from \"Meet the Fockers\" and Janeane Garofalo (which i personally like as well) known for her work with Ben Stiller on \"Reality Bites\", \"Mystery Men\" and lot's of other projects. So i rushed to the counter to make this disc (full of visual moments of adventure) all mine. <br /><br />I honestly did expected much more from the storyline, i couldn't watch it in one time, it's getting so boring so i took couple of days of interval before i finished the movie. Sorry, but in such cases i rather read something in between. But at the same time if they had more money on this project. They probably did much better job than the final result. Sound and visual shout for improvement. Crap movies like \"The whole 9 yards\" for example, had much, much more financial backup so they get more attention and credit. <br /><br />I would say, nice try, they did it because they have guts, less afraid to fail. Bruce Willis started with \"The Moonlightning\" as well. Look at him, he managed to survive that and he's big boy now. But retail price 3,50 is exact wright amount to ask for, no one deserve to get reach on this movie. This is kind of a student-introduction movie and not like: Hey, give me your wallet!\n",

It's even better to have some lame old jokes than. <br /><br />Watched the movie with six people who love love all kinds of comedy from Hollywood to British comedy, from satire to black comedy.

      "'The Seafarers' was a half hour documentary made for the Seafarers International Union in 1953. It's actually more of a promotional film than a documentary, urging sailors to join the union & extolling the benefits, etc etc. The 1950s equivalent of a corporate video or an infomercial.<br /><br />There is absolutely nothing remarkable about this film. It's competently made, but it's not the sort of project where a director would have the opportunity to exercise any sort of creativity. Kubrick was a hired gun on this, he did the job he was paid for & that's it.<br /><br />Any attempts to look for trademark Kubrick touches or innovation would be pointless.<br /><br />There are only two things noteworthy about 'The Seafarers' - it was directed by Stanley Kubrick, and it happened to be his first film in colour. Other than the title reading 'Directed by Stanley Kubrick', I found nothing of any interest whatsoever. There's nothing wrong with it, but it would be utterly forgotten & ignored if it had not been directed by someone who went on to much greater things.<br /><br />Darth Nub\n",
      "This is considered, at least by IMDb, as Stanley Kubrick's \"first feature made in color\" and it was long thought lost. Well, first, it isn't a feature film but just a dreadfully boring promotional video for the Seafarer's Union and the narration makes Jack Webb's delivery on \"Dragnet\" seem emotional and off-the-cuff in comparison!! Now the awfulness of this film should NOT be held against Kubrick. Sure, it's dull, uninspired and stilted, but he was a young man who was hopeful of becoming a professional director one day and was dirt poor--so poor that he had to start at the bottom...and this is certainly the bottom! For a more fair idea of his potential, try watching his real first features--KILLER'S KISS and THE KILLING--two exceptionally well made low-budget films that proved the man could make a lot with nothing.<br /><br />Anyone who sees brilliance in this film is a fanatic and is not to be trusted! This film should have stayed lost, if you ask me! Don't say I didn't warn you!\n",
      "The Ritz Brothers are an acquired taste...like arsenic! Try as I might, every film I have seen these guys in I have thoroughly despised them. Now I read at least one review that liked this comedy(?) team, but I cannot stand them. I have reviewed quite a few films over the years by teams like the Marx Brothers, Olsen and Johnson, Wheeler and Woolsey, Abbott and Costello as well as the Three Stooges (all contemporaries of the Ritz's) and can say that for me, they are by far the least talented team of the era. Most of this is because unlike these other teams, there is no distinct personality for any of the three Ritz brothers. They all look pretty much the same and mug almost constantly for the camera. They also do not appear to have any talents other than acting goofy--not exactly a deep act! If you asked me which one was Harry or Jimmy, I certainly couldn't tell you--and I assume it's probably true for most people who have seen their films. So why, oh why, did they think to put these no-talents into Dumas' classic tale?! It's even more perplexing because the rest of the film is played so straight and the Ritz moments seem almost tacked on or an intrusion. I can only assume that studio chief Darryl Zanuck must have been insane at the time or under the influence! <br /><br />Other than the Ritz's antics, the rest of the film an an odd melange. On one hand, the ever-competent Don Ameche stars as D'Artagnan was not a bad casting decision--he was handsome and could sing quite nicely. The film also looked very nice. However, someone must have really had it out for Ameche, as in addition to saddling him the with Ritz Brothers, many of the songs they gave him to sing (in particular the first one) were simply awful. The tunes weren't bad but the lyrics...uggh!!! My house needed fumigation after several of them!<br /><br />What we have left are some decent actors trying to make the best of an untenable situation. They tried their best but the film simply was begging to be remade. My advice is to see the 1948 version with Gene Kelly or any of the more recent remakes, as they are head and shoulders above this 1939 mess--one of the few stinkers to come from this golden year in Hollywood.<br /><br />Overall, a tedious mess. The only good in the film I can think of is that it led to a clever episode of \"Leave it to Beaver\". The Beaver was supposed to do a book report on \"The Three Musketeers\" and instead watched this film and based the report entirely on it! Not surprisingly, he got an F and learned his lesson! I do wonder what this movie would have been like with the Marx Brothers and their zaniness. Sure, at the time they were employed by a different studio (MGM), but they could have really given the film a needed infusion of anarchy and goofiness.<br /><br />Not worth your time unless you are a 100% crazed movie freak (like me). Try ANY other version of the tale--it can't help but be better.\n",
      "After viewing this film I wound up scratching my head with so many questions of how this thing ever got made in the first place.<br /><br />Firstly three years before there was a straight dramatic version of The Three Musketeers that starred Walter Abel as D'Artagnan by RKO. That film was well received although it didn't transform Abel into a leading man. Why Darryl Zanuck made another version so soon is beyond me.<br /><br />Secondly Rudolph Friml wrote a fine operetta of The Three Musketeers in the 20s. The score here by Walter Bulloch and Samuel Pokrass is singularly unmemorable. Who knows why Friml's music wasn't used, but it should have been.<br /><br />Zanuck had the ideal D'Artagnan on his lot in Tyrone Power. But since Power didn't sing and Don Ameche always got sloppy seconds in roles at Fox, he got the part. Poor Ameche, he tried his best and he even gets into the comic elements of the film, but it's no good.<br /><br />At year 2004 very few people know of the Ritz Brothers. They were good burlesque comedians who Zanuck signed up. Their humor was of The Three Stooges variety, but each stooge had an individual personality. You can't tell one Ritz from the other. In the film they take the place of the real Athos, Porthos, and Aramis and they and Ameche bungle their way into one situation after another.<br /><br />Of the women in the cast I have to say that Binnie Barnes as Milady DeWinter gets into the spirit of the slapstick with the Ritzes.<br /><br />It's a mess this film, but more so when you think that a straight musical with the Friml score could have been done and now probably never will and a version with Ty Power as D'Artagnan would have been a classic.\n",
      "Elliott Gould is bemused and colorful as a Vietnam veteran back in college, stuck between a rock and a hard place; he's working semi-seriously towards getting his teaching credentials, and yet is stymied by his fellow classmates who want to protest the hypocrisies of the Establishment (with Gould's help), and also by his instructors, hypocrites with power who work by a double standard. Director Richard Rush occasionally does fluid work here, and the film has fervently funny and thoughtful scenes, however Robert Kaufman's hot-headed script, adapted from Ken Kolb's novel, is awash with half-realized ideas. The kids sound off violently against the University's directors, but we're never made aware of what they want--or what they want done about their concerns. Made during an era wherein young people hoped to change the world--and get laid--the characters in this picture nevertheless are just sounding-boards for the writer. Topics are brought up not to be discussed but to be challenged (and, in these cases, the kids are just as blind as their professional elders). Was that Kaufman's point, that student riots really ARE just violent preludes to sex and otherwise a waste of time? Gould's shaggy character rants and raves too, but his Harry Bailey presents a different problem: he cheats, he lies, he cuts corners, he heartily embraces his own set of values and yet is happily corrupt! A hypocrite himself, Bailey loves teaching, loves kids and their innocence, but he doesn't see his own short-comings--and I'm not sure the filmmakers do, either. Bailey is a one-sided writer's creation (and oddly, for a movie filled with so many liberal stances, Bailey--like most of the other characters--is anti-female and homophobic). Candice Bergen (in a wan performance) plays Gould's shiksa goddess girlfriend who doesn't like being called a WASP and who would give up everything to be married in the suburbs. She's continually put down for that, as if she's a sell-out, and yet how exactly would Gould live if he were to achieve his dream of being a high school teacher? As it is, he can't even pay the rent on his apartment! The riot sequences are staged for utter seriousness--and they are filmed and edited with precision--but they don't come organically out of this story, they are interjected for shock value. The rage and anger presented here is convincing, but the cause is confusing. These students don't seem to want peace at all, and neither does director Rush. The narrative is pushed towards violence for no other purpose except to vividly stage two movie riots. This is exploitation, and the crummy feeling one gets from the picture can be related right back to the people behind it: they're hypocrites, too. *1/2 from ****\n",
      "I saw this film as a student, when it first came out. As someone who was involved with important issues like the Vietnam War and civil rights and free speech, I was totally offended by the film's nihilism, the ideas that students demonstrate just because that's what today's students do, and that there are no substantive issues involved. The film is all about the main character's life style and sex life, and (as I recall) his meaningful, altruistic, innovative, and condescending attempt to teach literature to ghetto kids by getting them to read comic books.<br /><br />In addition, (as I recall) we are clearly supposed to sympathize with the main character for being in trouble because he was caught cheating at an exam. At the schools I went to at the time, we took our politics and social issues seriously, but our academics no less so.\n",
      "Elliot Gould salvages what is otherwise a very mediocre movie. Candice Bergen's early reputation as a bad actress was molded in part by this film, where virtually the only thing she does in Getting Straight is whine, whine, & whine. I remember watching this film for the first time, and thinking to myself \"Will somebody PLEASE slap her?\" Her father's dummies, Charlie McCarthy & Mortimer Snerd, were better actors than her, and made better movies. Elliot Gould did M*A*S*H that same year, and built a well-deserved reputation as an excellent actor, even though he's had his cinematic ups-and-downs since then, like most actors. His work in Getting Straight is excellent, but unfortunately is balanced out by a typically bad performance by Candice Bergen.\n",
      "GETTING STRAIGHT is the most hippiest movie I've ever seen. The story is so lame and the acting is awful(especially Elliott Gould). The diologue is so corny that it's sad and painful to watch and listen. The only reason I saw this movie is because it had a young HARRISON FORD play a small part as one of the hippie students on campus. It's kind of funny seeing Harrison Ford with long hair trying to be a hippie. His performance was good for the time he's on screen but not even that helps this movie out at all. What really ruins this movie is Elliott Gould's over acting! It's so annoying watching him criticizing everything and everyone that you just want to punch him right through the screen. It doesn't matter what every other user comment says about this movie, don't waste your money watching it.\n",
      "**SPOILER** Rather boring film about a psycho mass-murdering mother whose adventures are covered up by her loving hubby and daughter. Things go awry when she kills her husband and the daughter flips out and then the story really doesn't know what to do (About 18 minutes into the film).\n",
      "I've seen many, many horror movies, but this one beats it all and I don't mean in a good way. First of all the film was obviously very very cheap. The camera work is the worst I've ever seen. The story is so stupid and implausible, that you got the feeling they wrote the script it in one hour. The actors are all so bad, it's beyond belief. But the worst of it is, that there is no humor at all. There are just some mediocre tasteless gore effects for splatter fans. On the video cover is written, that this film is a psychological Thriller - far from it ! It's nothing but a bad, dumb little movie,that has no, really no qualities. 1 out of 10.\n",
      "Twaddle, Badly scripted, Badly acted And badly directed. A badly thought out attempt to cash in on a successful series. The Characters are wrong, both staff and pupils and the plot line is none existent. The driving force seems to have been the desire to dress women in cartoon school uniforms and leer at them. None of the feigned naive innocence and fun of the other four films is present Every one involved in it should be thoroughly ashamed. Millicent Fritton must be spinning in her grave.<br /><br />P.S. It is enough to say that when the St. Trinian's films were released as a box set of DVDs this one was not included. Even the distributors at Studio canal cannot of thought it an actual St. Trinian's film.\n",
      "How many \"St. Trinian's\" films were made altogether (not counting the new 2007 version) ? If you said four, based on the fact that that is how they are packaged on DVD into a two-disc four-film box-set, then you would be mistaken - there were in fact FIVE films to this series, this last one coming fourteen years after the last effort, \"The Great St. Trinian's Train Robbery\". Like that film, it was also made in colour (the first three were in black and white), but the end product shares very little else in common with any of it's four predecessors. Claiming that George Cole was asked to reprise his role as \"Flash\" Harry cuts no ice with me - this film is such a mess casting-wise as to be unbelievable.<br /><br />At the time this was made, in 1980, the trade union movement was a lot more militant in nature than they are today (the \"Winter of Discontent\" fresh in peoples minds), and it's true to say that the TUC card-carrying Sun-newspaper reading working-class audience this film aimed itself at probably didn't like to see their union movements mocked on the big screen.<br /><br />\"Carry On... At Your Convienence\" was a huge loss-maker at the time of its cinematic release for mocking the unions, and this factor probably also had some effect on the success - or lack thereof - of \"Wildcats\". It's not a good idea to mock your key audience demographic by making fun of trade unions. All in all though, it wasn't really a good idea to make this film, and this is easily an entry that the \"St. Trinian's\" franchise could have done without. The fact that this fifth film is overlooked by the other four in the series is probably a good thing. This is an interesting curio for anyone who has ever seen and enjoyed the other four films in the series (or likes ogling actresses in school uniforms - gym-slips, stockings, suspenders, heels, etc.) but is nowhere near the quality of any of its predecessors. Very few people will ever get the chance to see this film. You should probably be grateful. Not that bad, but not that good either. 3/10\n",
      "I've seen all the other St Trinians films, and the superb (and superior) forerunner The Happiest Days Of Their Lives, so I felt that I should watch the 1980 film, even though I'd read somewhere that it was poor.<br /><br />Poor is an understatement. The script is awful. The acting is dreadful - doubtless the cast would blame the script but really they are equally at fault.<br /><br />This is probably the worst British film that I've ever seen - certainly it's the worst portion of a franchise. If you think that some of the 1970s Bond films are bad - try watching The Wildcats of St Trinians.<br /><br />Not one for a blu-ray release...\n",
      "Director Meg Richman has tried, as others have tried, to convert a Henry James literary work into a compelling movie, but falls far short, as others have before her (see 'Wings of the Dove,' 'The Bostonians,' 'The Ambassadors,' 'Portrait of a Lady,' and 'Daisy Miller').<br /><br />James's novels and novellas, based on the late-Victorian age of social suffocation (most often visited upon women yearning to be free), are ponderous and often very depressing examinations of love, deceit, devotion, recklessness, human folly. The list goes on and on. If it's about the strictures of human emotion, James is your man. His great strength in print is his weakness when transmitted to the screen: he conducts painstaking examinations of humanity's inner self, and is a challenge to read. Those who try to adapt his films (and try to be faithful to them) tend to sink under the weight of his relentless psychological questions. <br /><br />'In the Shadows,' AKA 'Under Heaven' and 'In the Garden,' is at least a two-hankie drama that is based on 'Wings of the Dove.' It is partially effective, but it ultimately becomes basically yet another one of them thar soap opries, replete with hokey dialogue.<br /><br />If you watch the theatrical trailer for this film, you'd think you were going to watch something entirely different. The trailer suggests a hot-blooded, scandalous examination of secret sex and intrigue. In other words, as so often happens, the distributors must have decided the flick needed more 'juice,' more 'edge' when no such 'juice' or 'edge' existed. We know going in what is going to happen in this movie, and any number of sensation-making trailers will not change things.<br /><br />Molly Parker as Cynthia and Aden Young as Buck give surprisingly good performances as lovers who are transformed by a series of sad events. But I was really surprised by Joely Richardson's performance. She is a classically trained actor, but she seems to be miscast in this movie. She seems indifferent to her part (for good reason it seems to me), and speaks her lines with a flatness that is almost comical. \"This love is strong,\" she intones to Buck (Young), \"stronger than cancer.\" Embarrassing. (Coincidentally, Richardson's real-life mother, Vanessa Redgrave, who has never given a bad cinematic performance, still had to struggle in the 1985 adaptation of James's 'The Bostonians'. It didn't work: the movie was one boring flop.)<br /><br />Richman deserves a lot of credit for trying to rework James, to try and give us a 'serious' film amidst all the popcorn crap. But to me it's a pretty lost cause. It's very hard to pull James out of the insufferable parlours of the 19th century.\n",
      "If anyone has seen Days of Heaven, there's no need to suffer through Under Heaven. The tension and credibility have been drained out of this Wings of the Dove remake. An interesting cast has had all their life and spontaneity removed. Heavy-handed movie-making at its worst because there's talent wasted here.\n",
      "A revisit to Wings of the Dove. Uneven performances and a sometimes self-indulgent script all in a really cool house. The story is basically the same principle: a young woman get her lover to become the lover of a dying rich woman. None of the characters are really likable, but neither are they nasty enough to hate. They fall right into that \"annoying, but if they're your friends, I guess they can come to dinner\" category.<br /><br />Despite all of this, there are points where its manipulative sentimentality actually leaks through. As the young man and Joely Richardson fall in love, you can't help but appreciate the feeling of danger and dread that accompanies it.\n",
      "This is a bad movie that purports to be an educational film designed to warn America about the menace of teenagers running amok thanks to uninvolved parents. However, like almost all the so-called \"educational\" films of the 30s and 40s, it was really a shabby little film designed to be snuck past the censors of the Hays Office. In 1934, the major studios all agreed to abide by the dictates of a stronger Production Code--eliminating sex, nudity, cursing and \"inappropriate\" plots in films (these had actually been relatively common in films in the early 30s). However, in an effort to sneak in smut, small studios created films to shock adults when they learn about terrible social ills, though they were REALLY intended to titillate and slip adult themes past the censors! Such films as MARIJUANA, MAD YOUTH, REEFER MADNESS and SEX MADNESS were all schlocky trash that skirted past the boards because they were supposedly educational. Even though they were laughably bad, they also made money due to low production costs and because they often offered nudity, violence and sordid story lines--all in the name of education! <br /><br />Unlike many of these films, DELINQUENT DAUGHTERS didn't have nudity, but it sure had lots of sleazy story elements that were sure to titillate. In this film, teens drank, used drugs, committed pointless robberies and assaults and drove like maniacs--all apparently the result of poor parental guidance. And as a result, kids died in this movie--and in the most spectacular ways! The acting and writing were almost universally bad, though the sequence where the judge tells off the parents of these punks actually was amazingly good--too bad everything else was pretty lousy. In fact, one character was so bad, so annoying and so gosh-darn awful, I nominate the ditsy blonde as the most annoying character of the 1940s--she was THAT bad!! Her voice was more grating than Olive Oyl's and she was practically sub-human in her stupidity!\n",
      "This was on the compilation DVD, Cult Classics. The transfered print was awful. There was a big scratch running through print for about fifteen minutes. About fifteen minutes of the night material was so dark that you might as well be listening to the radio.<br /><br />What can be seen is quite poorly written. We are talking Ed Wood bad here. A woman pulls a gun on a man. The man says, \"What have you got there.\" She answers, \"Something that goes boom, boom, boom!\" <br /><br />Teara Loring is interesting as a real sociopath. She really enjoys lying and stealing. Mary Boward gives a cute performance as a blond airhead, more blond and more airhead than anything in movies until Marilyn Monroe's comic performances.<br /><br />Fifi D'Orsay is funny as a French woman.<br /><br />Other than a few interesting performances, the bad dialogue and inane plot make the film difficult to take seriously. It is only redeemable for a few camp moments.\n",
      "PRC was just about the last studio on poverty row. Expectations for one of its productions were about rock bottom, and for the most part this exploitation quickie lives down to that well-earned reputation. The sets are cheap and few, the script darn near incoherent, the lighting and camera work fit for a bat's cave, and the acting wildly variable. Actually, some of the performances are pretty good-- Dawson and Loring are believable toughies, while Carlson and her swain come across as genuinely nice kids. However, D'Orsay's French accent is about as good as mine, at the same time Bovard's silliness is enough to make you reach for a stick. <br /><br />One reason to check out a dead-ender like this is for its glimpse of teenagers past, that is, of how Hollywood framed teens during the stressed-out war year of 1944. Note how much of wanton teen behavior is blamed on the parents. Much of that behavior is obviously hyped for exploitation purposes (the gun battle, the stick-up), but the question of responsibility remains valid. What surprises me is that there is no mention of the war that was still raging in 1944. Youth Runs Wild, a more serious RKO teen film from that same year, shed a lot of light on how gas rationing and 24-hour factory shifts, for example, affected young people's behavior. None of that here. These youths and their parents appear to exist in an historical vacuum, and I'm not sure why. Maybe the producers thought war concerns would complicate the titillating plot. Whatever the reason, the only value to scoping out this ultra-cheapie is curiosity for curiosity's sake.\n",
      "After high schooler Lucille commits suicide, the police arrive on campus and start grilling the squeaky clean teens to find out the whys and wherefores. Good girl June (June Carlson from the long forgotten Fox series of Jones' family comedies) is more than happy to answer their questions, airhead Betty (Mary Bovard) would cooperate if only she could successfully string together more than two or three words to create a coherent sentence, and bad girl Sally (Teala Loring, sister of Debra Paget) won't give them the time of day. Detective Hanahan (Joe Devlin) has the right idea, though, and suspects that local hood Nick Gordon (Jon Dawson) and his moll Mimi (Fifi D'Orsay) are implicated in some way in the girl's death. This low, low budget PRC production is thoroughly predictable in both the story and production departments, with most of the film shot against very poorly lit cardboard interiors. Sinister Cinema's print is in splicy but watchable condition.\n",
      "So I'm watching the flick, and I start thinking to myself - Good grief, did people actually pay good money to watch stuff like this back in the Forties? Yeah, I know, admission was probably only about a quarter at best, but still, you could have had a couple sodas at the malt shop. Straight out of the exploitation/educational film camp, \"Delinquent Daughters\" attempts to instruct and admonish parents for the 'Alarming Increase of Juvenile Delinquency' as touted in a newspaper headline quote from J. Edgar Hoover. I have a pretty good idea that none of the genre's films had much impact regarding their intended mission, other than the covert one of titillation and cheap thrills.<br /><br />As far as this one goes, it's pretty uneven in both the acting and production values. The print I viewed from the Mill Creek Entertainment set of 'Cult Classics' was of questionable quality; it was easy to pick out the night time scenes because they all looked like they were filmed completely in the dark. The story follows the off screen set up of a high school girl suicide, and goes on to explore the antics of various teenagers, none of whom seem to feel any remorse for the dead teen, who one describes as 'a nice girl but no angel'. It would have seemed more appropriate if the picture explored the angst these high schoolers felt over the death of a friend, but it seems she didn't have one.<br /><br />Hey, how about that Jerry (Jimmy Zahner), all worked up over the gun point robbery he pulled at the grocery store. He got away with $2.80!!! Who wrote this? And you can't beat old Rocky's (Johnny Duncan) logic in trying to convince June (June Carlson) to marry him - Martha Washington was only sixteen when she got married, and she wound up with a president! <br /><br />I guess the highlight, as a number of other reviewers have pointed out, was old Judge Craig's (Frank McGlynn) speech to gathered teens and parents alike noting that the proper attention and discipline might have prevented all the bad things from happening in their kids' lives. More simplistic than compelling, one comes away with a feeling of 'Yeah, right', just as the scene dissolves into a decade early preview of American Bandstand to provide a happy ending. Not one of the better flicks in the 'Cult Classics' collection, you might want to check out one of their drug, sex or alcohol treatments instead.\n",
      "1st watched 1/22/2007 - 3 out of 10(Dir-Albert Herman): Mediocre, at best, juvenile teenager drama which starts at the onset of a high school girl killing herself with the authorities trying to find out why. Of course, the kids remaining aren't much help as they were all out partying together the night before and don't want their parents to find out. None of the kids show much sympathy, which appears to be the point of the movie -- if you're a bad girl and party you lose all your sensitivity. Although later in the movie, the tables turn and the parents are shown to blame -- which was a nice turn(with a good scene with the judge helping the parents understand where they were going wrong), but it comes too late in the movie(about ¾ of the way thru). For the most part the acting is pretty bad and the lighting on some scenes is so horrible that you can barely tell what's going on(this may have just been the age of the movie, though). Besides this, the movie tries hard from a story perspective, but turns out to be pretty much a snoozer that you're just waiting on to end.\n",
      "(Some Spoilers) Straight out of todays-Summer of 1944-newspaper headlines the film \"Delinquent Daughters\" focus on the epidemic of juvenile crime that's was sweeping the country during the war years in the early and mid 1940's.<br /><br />We have this local hood and his moll Nick Gordon & Mimi, Jon Dawson & Fifi D'Orsay, running this teenage watering hole, supposedly serving soda pop and milkshakes to its under aged customers, the Merry-Go-Round Cafe. The Merry-Go-Round is instead getting the teenagers both juiced up, on hard liqueur, and doing Nick's and Mimi's dirty work. It's when local high school girl Lucille Dillerton is found drowned and boozed up after she jumped off a pier that the police headed by J.Edger Hoover look-alike Det. Hanahan, Joe Devlin, start to put the screws on Nick & Mimi's joint.<br /><br />With Nick just too slick to get caught with the goods on him all Det. Hanahan could do is wait for him to make a mistake. That's exactly what happens when Nick starts to make eyes on pretty and well stacked high school girl Sally Higgins, Teala Loring. It's Sally's boyfriend Jerry Syker, Jimmy Zahner,who's been knocking off bars gas stations and groceries for Nick who split the take, 90% for Nick and 10% for Jimmy, with him. Jimmy got the sh*t end of the stick, in the money he robbed, even though he was the one who put his a** on the line doing the robberies and at the same taking an eager, looking for both action and excitement, Sally along with him on his crime spree.<br /><br />It's when Mimi is brought into police headquarters for questioning that Let. Hanahan drops a bombshell about her cheating boyfriend Nick Gordon planning to drop her for the much younger and sexier Sally Higgins. Sally's boyfriend Jerry had earlier participated in a payroll robbery with Nick where he and a security guard were shot and killed. Now seeing that there's a future, in crime, for her with Nick Sally willingly replaced Mimi as Nick's new squeeze. Mad as hell Mimi not only implicates Nick in the string of robberies including a number of murders, one of a cop, in and around town but confronts her ex-lover Nick and her replacement, Sally, at the Merry-Go-Round-Cafe.<br /><br />After getting into a vicious eye scratching and hair pulling cat fight with Sally Mimi ends up getting belted by Nick who then together with Sally take off in his car away from the perusing, and now on to Nick & Sally, police headed by Let. Hanahan. The movie ends with teenagers June Tompson and her boyfriend and soon to be husband Rocky Webster, June Carlson & Johnny Duncan, forcing Nick off the road. Nick and his new love Sally end up at the bottom of a cliff crushed and burned to a crisp.<br /><br />Unlike Jerry and Sally June and Rocky didn't fall for Nick's boastful promises of making them rich and famous, or better yet infamous. The two youngsters not only stayed away from Nick's criminal activities but did what they could to both prevent and put an end to them.<br /><br />Besides the hooky dialog and bad acting the movie had some of the worst lighting you'll ever see, or not see, in a motion picture! Even in an extremely low budgeted turkey like \"Delinquent Daughters\". There were a number of scenes in the movie that looked like they were filmed in the bottom of a two mile mine shaft with the miners helmet-lights batteries having gone dead!\n",
      "I love disaster films, even the bad ones, but this one is completely horrible. From the acting to the special effects this one is crap. The script is laughable and the whole affair is absolutely boring. The \"Avalanche\" doesn't happen till around the hour mark and all we get till then is totally blinding boredom. Mia and Rock barely have anything to do (god knows why they actually did the movie), Robert Forester is hot but the character is bland, and Jeanette Nolan is under used in the only entertaining role in the flick. The rest of the cast are forgettable and not all that all-star. The action is contrived and \"special effects\" are for the most part low-budget 70's-ish.<br /><br />This movie would make a great sleep aid. It's bad, not enjoyably bad, just bad. It's bland and pointless. Skip if at all possible.\n",
      "I was surprised to see that Avalanche was produced by Roger Corman of all people. I would think that even the skimpy budget that this film had by Irwin Allen standards was not something Roger Corman was used to dealing with. <br /><br />Corman didn't spend it on big name guest stars for sure. His stars are Rock Hudson and Mia Farrow. Hudson is the Donald Trump like owner of a big state of the art ski lodge which is hosting that weekend some winter sporting events. He's been told like William Holden in The Towering Inferno that the lodge is in a bad place and the snow looks like it's about to come a tumbling down.<br /><br />Tumble down it did during a storm when a plane crashes into the top of a mountain. The Avalanche starts and it buries the whole cast in that white stuff. <br /><br />This is a disaster film made on the cheap, some winter sports footage mixed with real avalanche footage and some cheesy special effects by seventies standards to bind it together. The plot such as it is, is almost non-existent, the characters are never developed in the slightest, so you don't really care about them.<br /><br />I guess the lesson to be learned from Avalanche is for Roger Corman not to try to be Irwin Allen.\n",
      "I remember seeing this on T.V. in the early '80's, and even though I was still kind of young, I thought it was awful. <br /><br />Rock Hudson should really have been more selective of the scripts he accepted. some of his films are really good, and others like \"embryo\" and this piece of drek should have been left to the next generation of actors.<br /><br />now for the scene that I thought was the funniest of the whole movie. it happens at the very end as the camera is pulling away and the screen starts to fade to black. If I remember the scene correctly, a group of people are still in either a wrecked hotel or a cave and some guys wife has just been declared dead. as the camera pulls back you can clearly see the \"dead woman\" stand up and walk off set.\n",
      "\"AVALANCHE\" is definitely one of the weaker entries into the 'disaster' genre that populated the 70's and early 80's. A cast of fading actors and the \"who's that?\" of Hollywood headline this atrocious production that delivers more laughs than anything.<br /><br />Following the formula of its preceding disaster foes, \"AVALANCHE\" combines interwoven plot-lines involving love affairs and the disaster itself. Thrown into this sorry melange are Rock Hudson, Robert Forster, Mia Farrow and 50's silver screen star, Jeanette Nolan.<br /><br />In \"AVALANCHE\", Rock Hudson is David Shelby - a well-meaning but extremely foolish ski-resort owner who has ignored all warnings from environmentalists in building a new ski-resort while removing all the trees in the process which spells the perfect recipe for disaster. Robert Forster is the environmentalist who warns Hudson that removing all the trees from the mountain will result in causing deadly avalanches. Mia Farrow is Hudson's ex-wife, new love interest to Forster and Jeanette Nolan is Hudson's flighty mother who likes nothing more than a Bloody Mary to sip on every five minutes.<br /><br />Also thrown into this sordid tale are further cardboard cut-out characters including a champion skiier who is hell-bent on bedding as many women as he can before the screen credits go up and his jilted lover (wonderfully portrayed by Cathy Paine) who hams it up in a campy performance that involves her threatening to slice his cheating 'ass' with a butter knife before having a cup of milk thrown onto her as she falls to the floor screaming hysterically.<br /><br />Rock Hudson in his early 50's (his first foray into the 'disaster' genre) appears like a disheveled modern-day version of William Shatner. Spending precious minutes on-screen wearing nothing but turtle-necks and begging Mia Farrow to 'come back' to him, he looks quite ridiculous in a role that was intended for someone in their 30's as Mia Farrow is only about 33 years old at the time this movie was made. Much like \"EARTHQUAKE\" where Charlton Heston was courting a young Genevieve Bujold and \"THE CASSANDRA CROSSING\" where Ava Gardner was shagging a youthful Martin Sheen, the love affair in this movie is quite unbelievable.<br /><br />Robert Forster, fresh off his canceled television stint in the short-lived 1974 \"NAKIA\", proves a credible character as an environmentalist who foresees the inevitable disaster, yet cannot convince a soul to believe or listen to him. As a result, the second plot line enters and we see him and Mia Farrow sharing a love scene together. <br /><br />Jeanette Nolan in all of her faded beauty, spends most of her screen time either getting drunk on a Bloody Mary or hamming it up as the 'ever-loving mother' who travels everywhere with her gay companion.<br /><br />The setting is Hudson's ski resort. Everyone is there for the grand opening which also includes some ridiculous mini Winter-Olympics festivities which has several hundred people either cross-country skiing, down-hill skiing, ski-dooing or watching the skating events and of course, what better day would there be to have a disaster than on this particular day?<br /><br />The biggest laughs here of course is the disaster itself. In reality, there is nothing the slightest bit amusing about an avalanche, but while watching this movie, you can't for a second take it seriously. A huge snow wedge hangs over the resort, loosely hanging on a snow-capped mountain that is broken off once a small charter plane crashes into it. Once the avalanche starts, the laughter begins. Stock footage of avalanches are spliced onto the film (you can tell by the grainy imagery and the totally different mountain ranges). The snow itself is nothing more than a smoke-machine adjusted to 'fast forward' and huge blocks of styrofoam that are hurled through the air and bounce off the victims as they try to run away.<br /><br />One particular hilarious scene involves a skater who is still spinning pirouettes on the ice as the avalanche engulfs her and the crowd (like she couldn't hear or see the avalanche coming until it was about one foot away from her?). Another hilarious scene would involve a 'gas' explosion inside the resort that is nothing more than a 'puff of smoke' that sends one chef flying backwards into some shelves and an unlucky female that goes sliding along a counter while knocking off bowls of food onto the floor. But the one scene that really killed me was seeing the 'animated sparks' that flash from the broken gear box that controls the ski-lift. We actually get to see this twice during a climatic scene involving a man and a child dangling from a broken ski-life. Here, rescue workers scramble to rescue the child using a safety net below, yet the man that is left dangling spends about three minutes complaining that he cannot 'let go' and when he finally does (as a result of getting electrocuted), his lifeless body misses the safety net anyway!<br /><br />Furthermore, back in town as the ambulances and rescue workers are dispatched from their outposts, it just goes to show that if the avalanche didn't kill you, then these silly fools just might. In a totally ridiculous scene, ambulances and fire trucks spin out of control as they skid across the icy roads, causing serious fender-benders and sending one poor by-stander into a store-front window in a shower of shattering glass.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the person who I felt sorry for the most was Jeanette Nolan. Once she gets trapped inside the hotel resort with her 'companion', it takes her no longer than five minutes to go into hysterics and play the \"We're all going to die!\" card as she digs at the snow with a chair. Then she starts to lose her mind as she plays the \"We go back a long way...\" card with her companion as she strikes the keys of a busted up grand piano, warbling a few notes of a song long forgotten. On top of that, she passes out just as Hudson and Forster make their way into the resort from the outside. After she has been resuscitated and placed into the back of an ambulance, she and Mia Farrow are driven to the hospital by some suicidal maniac who insists on doing wheelies on black ice and devastated terrain that results in the ambulance crashing through a bridge and into a chasm, Farrow managing to fall out of the car in time but leaving Nolan and the driver to meet a fiery death as the car explodes at the bottom of the chasm.<br /><br />The climatic and grand finale scene of the film involves Mia Farrow hanging off the broken bridge railing and Hudson and Forster coming to her rescue. And when the day finally rolls to its end, Hudson and Farrow toast to the past events with a bottle of Champagne!!! Timeless!<br /><br />If you want to see a scene involving Jeanette Nolan doing her best 'Saturday Night Fever' impression on the dance floor, then this is the movie for you. If you want to see a pandemonium scene involving screaming victims getting hailed with styrofoam blocks, then this is the movie for you. However, if you want to see a half-decent disaster movie, then \"AVALANCHE\" is not the movie for you. The only thing that really separates \"AVALANCHE\" from the rest of the disaster entries are the few nude scenes that are thrown in involving a woman baring her breasts and buttocks in a 'steamy' pool scene that really does nothing much for the movie itself.<br /><br />This has got to be one of the stupidest movies that I have ever seen!<br /><br />My rating - 2 out of 10\n",
      "Hey, someone had to die of a little snow in the 70s..it was bound to happen. If whatever hack made this hadn't bothered, Irwin Allen would have..but to give credit where credit is due, Allen would have cast this better. Even if the movie stunk to high heaven (hello, 'The Swarm'), at least there were enough stars to keep you from falling asleep.<br /><br />Also to give credit where it is due, there is some really beautiful cinematography, especially in outdoor shots of Mia Farrow swimming and another scene of a skier trying to outdistance an avalanche is shot very well. <br /><br />However, once the cast starts talking, the groans can begin. Rock Hudson and Mia Farrow seem like they wouldn't even converse at a cocktail party; they are from different cinematic solar systems and should not have been paired here at all, even if they are a divorced couple. Robert Forster is semi-interesting as an predictable love interest for Mia and an ecologist who can predict the entire movie in his first scenes if only the screenplay had allowed him.<br /><br />Impatient action fans - tune in one hour after it started to see the extras get killed. Before that is alot of drama, and after that is the rescue, and that's all, folks.\n",
      "Avalanche is, quite simply, the WORST movie I've ever seen.<br /><br />The plot is dreadful, the script horrendous, the acting pathetic.<br /><br />I remember quite clearly that the patterns on the wall of the cinema were more interesting to look at than this piece of trash.\n",
      "Though Rock Hudson is my favorite actor, his acting in this film is very amateurish and highly unbelievable. Mia Farrow's performance is also wooden and I have seen better acting in school plays by grammar school students. Of course, the fact that other than a fake avalanche, there is no substance or story line that I could perceive to this film. The only good actor was Robert Forster and he also had the best script. I couldn't believe it was made in 1978 because I felt it probably was one of the training films made by new actors and actresses in order to develop their craft for Mia and Rock. I wouldn't view it again.\n",
      "I hated this movie. Yes, Ian Holm is a treasure generally but he overacts in this one. The slice of bohemia aspect never comes to the fore. Nor does the erstwhile theme of artistic exploration. Tucci accomplished all he hoped to accomplish here in The Big Night. In that film we had a visceral appreciation for the joy of \"creating,\" in that case great meals. And there were aspects of the interaction of art and commerce there were explored. Here, Tucci returns to some of those themes, but the return is a mess. Why does Gould not write? Why does Tucci's character ultimately stop writing? What does this tell us about the creative process? Beats me.\n",
      "I read Joseph Mitchell's marvelous collection \"Up in the Old Hotel,\" of which \"Joe Gould's Secret\" was a part, years ago and have always thought of it as one of my favorite books. I was so grateful that someone like Mitchell had made it his work to go around the city at mid-century and actually talk to people whose experiences of New York went as far back as the turn of the century, providing first-hand accounts of life in our fair city when things weren't so shiny and glossy as they are today. I always thought Mitchell a real hero.<br /><br />Now after this movie I think negatively of him. Was he really so callous toward this subject, Joe Gould, from the get-go? In the movie he never seems fascinated, but ultimately annoyed -- he seemed patronizing and dismissive from the very first. He wasn't depicted as a probing artist at all -- just a workaday family man doing his job to bring home the bacon. I just don't believe this about Mitchell.<br /><br />Will someone please make it illegal for actors like Stanley Tucci and Hope Davis to keep appearing in these cloying, precious little indies? I am so sick of them, particularly of her, what was at first her appealing acting style, the same in movie after movie after movie, now makes me want to shoot the screen. To me they seem to make these movies to feel good about themselves, \"aren't we cool that we find these interesting subjects and make movies about them,\" -- not to make the best translation into film form that they possibly can.<br /><br />Ian Holm was terrific and it was fun to see NYC at that time depicted. The New Yorker editor seemed spot-on. But I'm mad to have my sense of a personal hero sullied by this film of suspect intentions.\n",
      "Joe Gould comes across as an annoying and irritating character.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the character has no warmth to it. Instead, it grates on the viewer.<br /><br />The movie started OK, but as the Gould character came into itself, its shenanigans became too much to bear. The incessant bickering, the tantrums, the mood swings were just too much. At one point, the character was vandalizing a phone booth, and it was just not believable that the barkeeper did not kick his ass out of the establishment.<br /><br />Also highly irritating is the fake accent employed by Stanley Tucci for his Mitchell character. For some reason, it just doesn't work.<br /><br />All in all, I pretty much hated this movie, and could not wait for it to end. Some movies are not great, but are serviceable. After about 15 minutes, the Gould character makes this movie completely unwatchable.<br /><br />Todd\n",
      "This is the most annoying, if not the worst movie I've ever seen. Miss it if you have low tolerance for annoying actors who overdo it, especially if very fake and inconsistent southern accents drive you batty. Tucci needs to hire a real southerner, or get a voice coach, if he intends to make his character plausible. That's not a Tennessee accent, Stanley, it's from Mississippi (and Mississipians should be insulted by his performance as well). The only decent actors in the movie were everyone BUT Holm and Tucci. (Sorry to disappoint their fans). The movie was so annoying I took an unnecessary bathroom break which I extended by gazing at the clock at the concession stand and looking at the movie posters in the lobby. Finally I plodded back to my date (who was also hating it but was determined to use up the $7) and let myself be tortured for the remaining hour. The only good things about the movie were Susan Sarandon and my box of popcorn.\n",
      "Badly synchronized audio together with silly lines and mimicking of \"foreign speak\". I really don't understand how or where money gets raised to make movies like this. A mish-mash of diabolical characters scheming to perform \"dastardly deeds\". Although the plot is beyond being obvious I won't spoil the joy of any that are courageous enough to see this thing through the end. Be prepared to feel like bursting out laughing when the really \"bad guys\" pull some dirty tricks (for the benefit of the creative minds of the authors) with their eyes almost popping out of their orbits.<br /><br />Prague is a truly beautiful city and that is about the only positive aspect of this movie.\n",
      "A reasonably good start that obscures a really stupid and lame plot, as soon as it starts explaining it you think \"can't be serious, can't be SOOOOO absurd!\" The story does not stand up a child's mind, the acting is horrendous, the dialog almost non existent, the localization really cheap... the only achievement is to show Prague as a really ugly city, something not so easy.<br /><br />Really, paying to see this crap seems to be a really nasty way to lose money.<br /><br />For me, the only possible explanation for all that positive comments is that the people involved in the making of the movie are trying to improve its ratings. Incredible.\n",
      "I was unfortunate enough to catch a screening of Experiment at the Phoenix Film Festival, although I'll be honored to be the first on IMDb to warn you all of what you'd be getting into if you were to see it.<br /><br />A woman named Anna (Georgina French) wakes up in the middle of the street in Prague (where I'm assuming it was shot for cost reasons - first bad sign) without knowledge of her identity or even what language she speaks. Somewhere else in the city, a man named Morgan (John Hopkins) does the same. It all appears to be part of an experiment involving Stefan (Andrew Byron - utterly awful, in case I don't get to him later in the review) and Joseph (Nick Simons).<br /><br />The writing is simply awful, and the film has an awkward, shifty pace that ruins the mystery before it even has a chance to start. Some of the concepts here aren't completely bad - Anna and Morgan struggle with learning their own language in a completely foreign country, although the dialog and performances amount to confused stuttering that drags already unnecessary scenes out. There's an air of cheapness about the whole thing - the leaders of the experiment literally run the project out of somebody's basement (ridiculous when we learn how high up it goes), and in one hilarious moment, an attempted rapist gets up and walks out of the room after being knocked down by Anna. Very nonchalantly.<br /><br />When the actual plot is revealed in the last half-hour, the film starts to move - too late for those who wisely walked out, although they weren't missing much. Somehow the story shifts to an assassination attempt on the Prime Minister, which has nothing to do with the events that inevitably take place, and only seems to have been added to make the movie seem more epic and important. Instead, it's stupid and kind of funny. There's a predictable twist ending that brings absolutely no closure to the whole mess, and you're left with 90 wasted minutes. Don't let me forget to mention that the film had no lighting. Not low lighting for atmosphere, not dim lighting, but no lighting. At all. It's almost as if the filmmakers wanted to put you to sleep.<br /><br />If I have anything good to say, David Gant was pleasantly over the top as the mastermind behind the whole project, there's a nice pair of breasts, and the theme that is revealed in about the last fifteen minutes of the movie in a tossed-off manner of the fallacies of love & trust was pretty neat and I'd like to see it implemented in a good movie next time.<br /><br />Boo.\n",
      "Dane tries to hard and is to extreme with all of his yelling and going crazy, spilling water on himself and rolling on the floor. To much. Calm down, get yourself together and make us laugh. I didn't quite understand his comparison toward comics and rock stars. Just because there both up on stage or something? He said that every comedian wants to be a rock star. I'm sure Rodney Dangerfield was really into that when he was alive. He had a few good jokes like the Burger King joke where people yell at the drive thru. I also liked the Reese's Pieces joke. If Dane just didn't act so mental he might be funnier and I might have given this a higher rating, as high as maybe an eight.\n",
      "Mid-eighties grade-Z Indiana Jones knockoff starring David O'Hara as beer swilling tomb raider John Banning who unwittingly awakens an Egyptian sorceress Nefratis (Michelle Bauer) and becomes a pawn in her resurrected plans for world conquest, or something to that effect. <br /><br />When looking at the cast of actors one might get the impression that with such B-movie royalty like Sybil Danning, John Carradine, and the always entertaining Cameron Mitchell that this movie might not be as bad as it sounds. You would be very wrong on that assumption. While all aforementioned actors try their best to elevate the \"talent\" level on screen they are collectively in the film for only about ten minutes with Mitchell making up the bulk of that time. Instead you get to watch the \"don't quit your day job waiting at Spago's\" performance buy the woefully inept Richard Hench who becomes the central character in the film about halfway in to it. The scenes with Hench and his professor sidekick are the visual equivalent of banging your skull off of a concrete wall. David O'Hara's character John Banning is so unlikeable that it's confusing as to why he wasn't rewritten better as the film clearly wants him to be the hero. Michelle Bauer's nudity free Nefratis sleepwalks throughout the movie. If anyone can tell me what the hell actually killed her at the end I would greatly appreciate it as I rewound it many times and failed to see what exactly happened. My word of advice for wary B-movie fans is if it says Olen Ray stay away!\n",
      "This is not the worst film ever made. I can't think of what that one is at the moment. I'll have to wait for my eyes to stop bleeding.<br /><br />Actually, there are two mildly redeeming factors. John Carradine, whose two minutes on screen probably comprised half the movie's budget, and Kitten Natividad dancing topless for about thirty seconds total. Yeah, that's it.<br /><br />Another line. Another line. Another line. Another line. Is that enough for that ridiculously arbitrary ten line rule? Apparently not. Let's keep adding pointless text until this so-called comment meets the minimum requirement for mindless bureaucratic self-aggrandizement. Some suit trying to qualify his or her paycheck came up with this rule, undoubtedly.\n",
      "Hack director Fred Olen Ray unleashed this loser back in the mid eighties. \"Stars\" Sybil Danning and John Carradine are in the film for about 5 minutes each, and Cameron Mitchell has the good sense to not show up until about 50 minutes in and then gets killed about 15 minutes later. It's for sure none of these actors listed this on their resumes. As for our lead, David O'Hara, well let's just say he shouldn't have quit his coaching job. And the second male lead, Richard Hench, who doesn't enter the film until it's half over, seems to be reading his lines from cue cards offscreen. At times he appears to be in a trance. Some of the furniture has more life in its performance than he does. <br /><br />Of course most of the blame falls squarely on the director's shoulders here. Olen Ray can't seem to pace a scene to save his life; they all just drag on and on with the actors taking long, I mean long, pauses between each line of dialog. You can just feel precious seconds of your life slipping away while waiting for them to complete their discussions. Naturally we need some pointless t & a to pad out an already stretched film, and plenty of go nowhere scenes that do nothing to advance the \"plot\". The best I can say for this garbage is that it is only 84 minutes long.<br /><br />Skip this film and watch the 1980 flick The Awakening, which covers pretty much the same ground. While not a great movie, it's worlds better than this dreck.\n",
      "This movie is by far the worst I have ever seen, and coming from a guy that enjoyed Starship Troopers (1!!) that says alot. This one just has it all, it's a complete waste of time. They should put warnings on crap movies like this, honestly. At some point the woman makes a scarab crawl up some dudes \"skin\" which is CLEARLY and unmistakebly some rubber overlay. This tells me that not only was the budget really low, but the crew were also in a hell of a hurry and nobody could be arsed to tell the director he was really really bad. The make-up artists should be cursed for all eternity and beaten with various sticks. This is me, telling you, not to see this movie, unless you want to have something to talk about.\n",
      "I remember reading a write up on this film, the standard fare put out by the promotions people. It sounded exciting, horrific, all the things I enjoy about a good mummy movie. Then I got the box home and knew I was in trouble. The cheesy art of the box cover was the first clue. It could just have easily been the cover for \"Big Trouble in Little China\" which was a much better film, but this was no comedy, at least not intentionally. To begin with the budget on this must have been all of a $1.85 with tax. Then there are the sets. The film was supposed to take place in Egypt, but the sets bore no resemblance whatever. Cameron Mitchell is no actor, no way, never been. I was especially disappointed to see aging horror star John Carradine and Sybil Danning in this as they are both usually in much better quality work. You can safely give this one a miss, unless you are a fan of \"Plan 9 From Out Space.\" This is right down there with it.\n",
      "This feature is a grim, violent urban saga of a dysfunctional family that plays out amid the decay and ugliness of Harlem. This storied community, long neglected and portrayed as unredeemable, takes another hit as families disintegrate and drug wars are the order of the day. The film has an odd symmetry in that it opens and closes with scenes of drug overdoses which may explain why two impressionable youngsters who should know better get swallowed up drug distribution activities and violent crime. The movie also shows black men in a very poor light as every single character is flawed beyond measure and not one of them has a single redeeming quality. Besides the self-loathing of Harlem and its residents, the film's parallel theme serves up the familiar race war shoot-outs between black hoodlums and Mafia thugs who are determined to hold on to lucrative drug markets uptown. Wesley Snipes headlines a good cast that is sadly wasted in this picture. Michael Wright is very good as the angry, bitter Raynathan but with films like \"Super Fly\", \"New Jack City\" and several other films of this type out there, who needs another one?\n",
      "This film is just a boring load of old tripe.It made me wish I'd rented Snipe's apparently superior New Jack City instead.Wesley Snipes,like Bruce Willis,is an action man and should stick to that.This is just bottom shuffling torture,full of nasty scenes and crass language.Abominable.To be avoided.\n",
      "A typical Irwin Allen spectacle, this has its moments--the daring publicity stunt involving a tightrope walker crossing Niagara Falls is genuinely exciting--but for the most part is just too prosaic and small-minded to be the blockbuster it was undoubtedly intended to be. It would have helped if Victor Mature's shifty circus owner were either less of a jerk or an out-and-out villain, and certainly if Vincent Price (who seems to have been cast as the ringmaster simply because of his moustache) had been given more to do than to stand around in unbecoming leisure outfits. On the other hand, Peter Lorre (whose presence as a clown alienates both Lorre fans who view it as the ultimate insult to that ill-used actor's dignity, and clownophobes who see it as a confirmation of their worst fears) gives the film a heart and humor it wouldn't have had otherwise.\n",
      "We had high hopes for this movie. They were in vain. This is a classic example of a movie that had almost no thought put into its plot. It is a series of fights, interrupted from time to time with scenes of dialogue that raise more questions than they answer.<br /><br />The 13th Warrior begins with a scene of Ambassador Ahmet (who existed in real life) headed north after being sent away so he won't fool around with the king's wife. He and his small retinue bump into a passing Viking gang, and for reasons never explained Ahmet must join a band of 13 Vikings in a mission to help a semi-feudal village that is under attack. Even more odd is Ahmet's decision to join the Vikings. He already has a mission, and doesn't seem to be under any duress. Even a throw-away line along the lines of, \"I decided to go, so I could learn more about these North People who I will need to understand as ambassador\" would have helped. <br /><br />Along the way Ahmet learns how to speak the Viking language by, apparently, watching the Vikings talk. Never are we shown a Viking saying a word and tying it to an item, so that an observer might be able to attach meaning to the words. Yet somehow our hero learns the language. What are the odds of that?<br /><br />At this point The 13th Warrior becomes a sort of a Viking \"Seven Samauri,\" with our Viking heroes gathering the village people (the serfs, not the disco group, though if *those* Village People appeared it would not have surprised me) to defend the town against a band of cannibals who are (again) never fully explained.<br /><br />During the ensuring battle scenes, there is an attempt to show a juxtaposition between the culture of Ahmet the Muslum and Rennaisance Man and that of the crude but effective Vikings. For example, Ahmet has trouble wielding a Viking broadsword but once he has a curved scimitar made to order he is ready to rock (of course, later, when the band sorties on a mission to attack the cannibals, Ahmet has a Viking broadsword tied to his back and the scimitar is nowhere in sight). Also, just before a big battle, Ahmet suddenly drops to his knees to pray as Muslins do five times a day (though we never see him do it at any other time). Anyway, you can *almost* feel the threads of a plot here revolving around Ahmet as an observer of another culture, but it never is clear nor develops (just like the rest of the movie).<br /><br />There are many instances where events make no sense. The cannibal tribe at one point early on seem to have kicked the Vikings' butts and are burning the village, then withdraw at the sound of a horn for no apparent reason. It just means they have to attack again later, after the village has time to recover a bit. There also seems to be some voodoo involved in that the Vikings (and Ahmet, for a little while) don't know if the cannibals are men or spirits. It's unclear why there is any doubt, since the cannibals look like guys with animal headdresses and fall when they are stabbed. And throughout the movie it appears that the odds are something like 20 or 30 to 1 against the Vikings (and the cannibals are on horses!), yet somehow we have a happy ending.<br /><br />The movie *tries* to draw on a theme of honor and courage. The Viking leader is noble and fights until he can no longer fight. But that theme is underminded by the numerous ploy holes. Why should we care about these people and what they fight for? Why are there only 13? Why do the cannibals attack? How did this start? Without answers to basic questions (and no clear indication of a moral cause), the idea of honor falls flat.<br /><br />I cannot believe the average rating for this movie is 6.2. We gave it a 2.\n",
      "\"Crash\" had a lot of potential. I feel like I can criticize it harshly because I am a Cronenberg fan and this was nowhere close to his best work. The themes (sexual \"deviance,\" violence, obsession) that Cronenberg was exploring are very relevant to today's post-modern society. However, this film didn't get the message across. Supposedly the book by James Ballard deals more with our obsession with fame and celebrities; that was not dealt with in the film and it should have been. It would have resulted in a more coherent piece of art. As you watch the movie, you feel like a kid watching late-night TV and stumbling upon something \"dirty\" that you know you aren't supposed to see. That's about it. As an adult, you know that there is supposed to be symbolism, an underlying metaphor or allegory, but the viewer is never really let in on the secret. Instead, we see a lot of strange sex scenes, car crashes and empty dialogue. I wanted to like this film, but it was boring, a little pretentious, and left me wanting more substance. <br /><br />4 out of 10\n",
      "J.G. Ballard's perverse, and often coolly humorous, prose works are not really suited to the screen. If anybody could successfully transfer one, the likeliest candidate would have to be David Cronenberg. At least, that is what anyone would have thought before seeing \"Crash\".<br /><br />It seems it's best to leave Ballard to unsettle and disturb the printed page alone.\n",
      "I was forced to see this movie in the theater by my friends. I tought it would be a bad, semi-porn kind of movie. I wish it would have been that. It was actually worse. It is not only grotesque but also boring. The sex scenes (which includes 1 gay) are not at all good, sometimes disgusting. I can't believe that actors like Spader and Hunter acted in this movie.\n",
      "Crash is an interesting film, it is not the best movie I have ever seen, but it is one worth a watch. It has an odd story, but it is a very sensual film. The film has a wonderful cast, and Hunter, Spader, and Arquette are ok in it.\n",
      "I am giving the director the benefit of the doubt and assuming he was trying to make some sort of high-minded statement about sexuality, not just trying to revolt me. But the message is extremely muddled.<br /><br />In showing a ludicrous fetish nobody has ever displayed, maybe the film is trying to satirize sexual obsession. Or maybe it is some sort of commentary about pornography or relationships in modern society. Whatever the case, the point is very obscure.<br /><br />With the tone of ironic detachment, I felt I was being held at arm's length throughout the film and given no clue as to how I should feel about the characters. Am I supposed to sympathize with them, pity them? It's hard to do since they show about as much emotion as HAL in 2001. For people who are supposedly engulfed by sexual obsession, they sure are torpid.<br /><br />If I am going to watch extremely graphic sexual perversions, I would prefer them to be in a film that is a little more thoughtful and a lot less pretentious.\n",
      "A sick, twisted and perverted movie. Displaying penetration where it should not occur and showing what happens when unbalanced people are not brought up correctly. All in all, an interesting affair from Mr. Cronenberg.\n",
      "I don't know about other people but when I think of car crashes I think of destruction; I think of death; I think of loss; I think of the time and effort that it'll take to rectify not only the situation involving how the hell you're going to get around now the car's gone but also how you're supposed to recover from the shock of it. In David Cronenberg's ridiculous attempt at a film, when the character's think of a car crash, they think of sex and then some more sex and then even more sex after that.<br /><br />When I watch a film, I like them to have plots and developments and characters I don't spend the whole time despising for one reason or another. Sometimes, hating characters is good and can be done cleverly: disliking an evil character or not liking the ways in which certain characters go about their business can also be good fun but when you see a film that is just a barrage of sex scenes, bizarre characters talking like they're in some sort of drug induced stupor and silly, unbelievable developments; it's very difficult to not only switch your mind off to what's going on but also be tempted to not switch the film off.<br /><br />Alas, Crash is a film that just wants to shock. It's like an eight year old child that you get in stores or any other public place, begging their parents for more of what they already have and making a really big deal about absolutely nothing for no reason; it's like the attention hungry child who wants everyone to notice them or the co-worker who 'bigs' themselves up to the point where you just don't care because you don't believe what you're hearing  in Crash's case, it's 'hearing'. A film critic or maybe they were a film theorist once said that: \"Cinema is a way of looking into other people's lives  people who only exist on screen and have no knowledge of the camera and us.\" In essence, this is what Crash is: it's a portal into the lives of James Ballard (Spader) his close to constantly naked wife Catherine (Kara Unger) who always talks like she's just had a shot of heroin and they're relationship which breaks up a little when James finds time to hang out with a bunch of equally annoying freaks in the form of Vaughn (Koteas), Gabrielle (Arquette) and a few other dregs whose main turn on are car crashes. This is one portal I wished I hadn't looked through.<br /><br />Crash just consists of a bunch of random sex scenes between two characters we don't even know in the first third, then consists of sex scenes between two characters we don't even give a damn about in the second third before trying to end up as some sort of tragic, poetic love story about two people who have now discovered what really sexually turns them on. Needless to say, it misses that particular mark by an absolute light year. There is one scene that is constructed and shot in such a way that it could resemble a sex scene in a film even though it's not. It's the scene when James and Vaughn are driving slowly past a crash site as Vaughn takes pictures of various things; getting off over the blood, the death and the way the victims are trapped: the camera shots are close ups of numerous things such as the still bodies, the blood on the door and the way the pliers are applied by the firemen as they crank down and break off the metal framework blocking them from rescuing the victims  this is not only disturbing in the sense it's supposed to be entertaining but odd that the film-makers assume that we even care about what's going on and think we will like these characters.<br /><br />Crash is a film that fetishises car crashes and glorifies them as if they're as desirable as sex is. In fact, take away most of Vaughn's dialogue and some scenes involving characters talk about nothing in particular and the film would be pornography. Pornography doesn't need to have a plot but when it does, I'm sure it's at a very basic level with minimal character development and talking; again, Crash fits these two descriptions and it's absolutely shocking  Crash is quite easily a wreck of a 'film' and probably one of the worst I've ever seen.\n",
      "The tag-line of this movie reads: 'The Most Controversial Film You Will Ever See'. Well, not only was it controversial to the extent to which it was subsequently banned in cinemas throughout the UK 11 years ago, but the narrative and plot of the film was as ridiculous as it was distasteful. The idea of people getting turned on by car crashes didn't just sound stupid and lame but also sick. I for one am not the reader of the English newspaper the Daily Mail. I am not even middle class myself and so therefore, my views on this film in no way are based on or influenced by some tabloid press but rather from a personal point of view. Thus, what I dislike most about Crash however is that it has a stupid and inane premise and the fact that it was such a terrible film in itself.<br /><br />The plot of Crash revolved around a couple whose husband played by Spader ends up paralysed in a car accident. Of course this doesn't stop him and his wife from doing it with each other and even with other people. Spader's character has him having sex with Holly Hunter, in addition to this he even has a homo-erotic encounter with a guy (not that I have anything against homosexuality whatsoever that is). In fact, one of the main problems with Crash is the rather daft plot- its all about sex, sex and sustaining injuries and losing control of their libido by dangerous driving and that its all done in a cheap, tacky, demoralising and distasteful manner. When they have sex, they don't do it out of love for the other person but rather out of sexual arousal, out of desperation and out of weakness. They couldn't really give a toss about the other person's feelings, or the people they hurt. If anything those characters in Crash come across as being selfish, as well as perverse.<br /><br />Another problem is the actual point of this film- what message is this trying to evoke to its audience? What can the audience themselves take away from this viewing experience? And is there a point to all this? The answers to those questions can only be answered by those able enough to come up with meaningful answers. But unfortunately, they have not been addressed or tackled whatsoever within this movie.<br /><br />I failed to see how I could empathise with or feel remorse for the main characters. In fact, I utterly despised watching this film, that I was thinking as I was seeing the events take place, 'What the hell was that?'. I'm sorry but getting aroused at the expense of others and endangering others by getting involved in car collisions doesn't make for a good movie. It looked so tacky and on screen, the scenes would've offended those of whom were lucky enough to survive a car accident or two.<br /><br />There isn't really a moral to this silly story because let's face it, with a complex and controversial subject such as sex, in Crash with car accidents and people having sex with each other and other people, how on earth can there be one, for sure? David Croenberg has come up with some very strange concepts for films- hell, we often watch scenes in TV sitcoms and dramas for instance where the character is a novice at driving the car, or is attempting to drive the car and the other guy says something like 'imagine that this car is a woman and you're in a relationship with her/it' or some silly crap such as that. However, this one takes the biscuit as it has become a step too far. <br /><br />Crash was a terrible waste of a film and in Spader, Hunter and Arquette- of whom are three undeniably good actors, their talents were virtually unseen in this so-called diabolical 'porn' fest. For me, it was a nonsensical piece of garbage.\n",
      "as fans stick up for it and say that haters don't understand its aims, I on the otherhand can understand its aims and the context and still think its a pile of rubbish. none of the depth and tales of wisdom that these images are meant to represent come across well enough, they whole movie smells of cheap cologne, its actually pretty boring and you really don't have to watch anymore than an hour of this rubbish as they narrative/story just don't exist. so he uses a car instead of heroine, or we are all to absorbed by technology, whatever, the film doesn't have enough to say to justify the running time of this ultimate fake arty farty rubbish. madonna in that film with the candle wax was more entertaining, and there are hundreds of films about addiction or technology with more panache and substance requiem for a dream, trainspotting, primer, . this should be burnt and just forgotten. i turned it off after 1hr 15. and then wrote this, cos i hate people who think this stuff is some how great, and if you don't like it, its because its just too cool to be appreciated. get over yourself Cronenberg, not saying the topic s not interesting but this is a lame attempt at film making from someone who really should know better.\n",
      "Yes, it was you, you are closed minded (And I realize the topic name makes no sense)<br /><br />IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A \"NORMAL\" MOVIE LEAVE THIS ONE ALONE! Also, it's no good for pornography (you'll just feel dirtier) If you didn't understand it or thought it was pornographic, you're probably a \"normal\" person(and/or haven't seen a good porno), and thats okay. The meaning is explained pretty well by some of the other posts if you need help. <br /><br />BUT I JUST WANT TO SAY...the people who REALLY GET the movie probably wont be affected by it in the way that the writer intended. Because they would already have so many of their own ideas about American culture. And they would probably say, \"Yeah? So?\" <br /><br />Does this make sense? <br /><br />My Boring story I watched this on Cinnemax and I thought it was the newer movie by the same title, which a friend had recommended to me. If you've seen this movie, you could imagine my surprise. At first I thought my friend had some issues. I soon realized of course, that it was a different movie. Ha ha hmm<br /><br />I gave it a 2 because I got through the whole thing. Its more captivating than Matrix 3\n",
      "Adapting JG Ballard's novel might have seemed like a good idea to a director as provocative as David Cronenberg, but if any book screamed un-film-able, it's CRASH. It may be filthy, but it's also extremely boring, which is especially disheartening considering the fact that at least two of Cronenberg's earlier films --- THE BROOD and THE FLY --- are masterpieces of modern horror. CRASH features a typically dull James Spader getting entangled with a group of car crash fetishists and having sex with various people including Holly Hunter and a hobbling Roseanna Arquette. Ballard's book was devoid of narrative and Cronenberg makes the mistake of trying to instill one. He's not successful and unfortunately CRASH is crap.\n",
      "I am at a distinct disadvantage here. I have not seen the first two movies in this series, although I have seen a lot of Larry Cohen films. Fans of the series seem to think this is a good film. Judging it on it's own, it was pretty boring.<br /><br />You never get a real good look at the maniac cop's (Robert Z'Dar) face, but what I did see was pretty grim. The death scenes seem to be staged to eat up the most film, not to give any thrills. Maybe if I saw the NC-17 Director's Cut, I may be more impressed.<br /><br />The ending with the car chase with Z'Dar, Caitlin Dulany, and Robert Davi was pretty intense. best part of the movie.\n",
      "Matt Cordell is back from the dead for a third go-round, although I'm not sure anyone cared at this point except for rabid MANICA COP fans. Cordell, who died in the last flick, is resurrected through voodoo, and is now hot on the trail of several miscreants involved in the shooting of a fellow officer Cordell is very fond of. I missed part of this early '90s low-budget quickie, but it was pleasing to see Cordell wracking up the body count in various, gruesome ways. Problem is, the overall film is pretty static, and Cordell simply ain't Jason or Freddy. The interest wanes pretty fast, even with that grand B-movie master Robert Forster as a doctor who ends up with his brains scrambled. Stick with the first film in the series, which is funny and scary and exciting, all at the same time.\n",
      "The supernatural, vengeful police officer is back for a third installment, this time acting as guardian angel for a wrongfully accused female cop. Standard stalk and slash picture, yet well acted and directed, thus making it oddly interesting and watchable, though the violence isn't for the squeamish (especially the director's cut which was originally given an \"NC-17\" rating).<br /><br />*1/2 out of ****\n",
      "Look, it's the third one, so you already know it's bad. And \"Maniac Cop\" wasn't good enough to warrant the second installment, so you know it's even worse. But how much worse? Awful, approaching God-awful.<br /><br />When Maniac Cop goes on a killing spree, a reporter exclaims, \"What happened here can ONLY be described as a black rainbow of death.\"<br /><br />1-- Rainbows are not black, and can never be. 2-- Rainbows are harmless, and can never inflict pain or death. 3-- A news reporter, one valuable to his agency, might find another way to describe the aftermath of a killing spree. \"A black rainbow of death\" is not the ONLY way to describe the given situation.<br /><br />This is what you're in for.\n",
      "This lackluster Errol Flynn oater qualifies as one of his minor efforts. Clocking in at a sheer 73 minutes, \"Montana\" doesn't waste its time getting down to basics, but the narrative has its lapses. One character shows up and then is gone without an explanation. The performances are good and the Warner Brothers production values are bed-rock. Seasoned western writers such as James R. Webb and Borden Chase penned the screenplay, but they deliver little in the way of memorable dialogue and there are absolutely no surprises in this formulaic horse opera. Some of the situations, like our hero being duped into riding an unbreakable bronco, are old hat.<br /><br />Basically, Morgan Lane (Errol Flynn of \"The Sea Hawk\") plunges his flock of sheep into cattle country in 1879 and the cowboys refuse to tolerate these sheep-nanigans. No sooner has Lane and his flock entered cattle country than the cowboys descend on them at night with their guns blazing death. An unarmed, young Mexican shepherd becomes the first casualty with a bullet in the back. The following day Lane and company encounter Papa Otto Schultz (S.Z. Sakall of \"Casablanca\") who drives his peddler's wagon into their camp. Lane and Papa Otto become partners almost instantly and the two ride into Fort Humboldt to peddle his wares. Initially, Lane receives a chilly reception in the Little Big Horn Saloon where Slim Reeves (Ian MacDonald of \"High Noon\") goads him into a showdown after he labels Lane a sheep-man. Although he knows that it isn't any of his business, a bearded, leathery-looking Tecumseh Burke (Paul E. Burns of \"Son of Paleface\") pokes his nose into the confrontation. The older gunman offers Lane the use of his hardware since our hero doesn't pack a pistol. Tecumseh warns Lane that the trigger is tied back and he will have to fan the weapon. Slim shoves the holstered revolver and gun belt at Lane. Everybody clears out of the way so the two can shoot it out. Tecumseh starts the countdown to three, but the bushwhacking skunk that Slim is tries to shuck his six-shooter on two. Lane blows the revolver neatly out of his adversary's fist as easily as he might blow out a candle. The ruffian apologizes because he insists no sheepman could possibly wield a shooting iron with such dexterity.<br /><br />\"Montana\" features a romance between the principal players. Predictably, it doesn't take our hero long to meet, greet, and get sweet with cattle queen Maria Singleton (Alexis Smith of \"San Antonio\"), even though she is engaged to marry rancher Rod Ackroyd. Lane has Maria eating out of his hand after he wagers that he can ride a bronco that nobody else has managed to stay aboard for a full minute. Sneaky Reeves whittles away at the cinch and Lane barely missing staying in the leather long enough. Apparently, the colossal loss of money that Papa sacrificed not only drove him out of his partnership with Lane but also out of the movie. Papa vanishes and is never heard from again. Meanwhile, Maria decides to lease Lane some land to run his steers on since he didn't tame the bronco. At this point, things take a turn for the worse for our protagonist. Inexplicably, Lane's sheep dog Jeanne prances into town that same day that Lane steps outside the bank with Maria with the lease for the land. Reeves and his cohorts expose Lane as a sheepman when the mutt goes to him. Naturally, Maria is furious, but what she doesn't know is that her fiancée has been two-timing her with the lawman's girlfriend. Indeed, the lawman, Sheriff Jake Overby (Lane Chandler of \"Samson and Delilah\") doesn't know that he, too, is being two-timed.<br /><br />Meantime, the ornery cattlemen cannot shed their deep-seated prejudice toward the mutton-minded Lane. Lane argues that sheep and cattle can get along together. He has seen it in Mexico, but the cattlemen don't believe him. Gunslinging cattleman Rod Ackroyd (Douglas Kennedy of \"The Lone Ranger and the Lost City of Gold\") leads the charge against Lane and his sheep and bites the dust. The showdown in front street at the end of the action looks like a mild imitation of \"Red River\" with our colorful heroine shooting the man that she loves. Flynn was looking a mite long in the tooth when he made this oater and the alcohol had robbed him of his spontaneity but not his charm. He looks a little more heavyset than usual. Smith doesn't look like she has changed since their last collaboration on \"San Antonio\" except that her outfits aren't as flamboyant. Mind you, she is a bit more hard-hearted and tough as a cattle queen who lost her father and brother in the war against the sheep herders.<br /><br />\"Montana\" doesn't rank in the same league with Flynn's more prestigious westerns like \"Dodge City,\" \"Virginia City,\" and \"They Died With Their Boots On.\" In fact, \"Montana\" rates as one of his least appealing westerns. At least the Technicolor makes this modest western look good. Strangely, the peddler that Sakall plays vanishes inexplicably from the action. If you want to see a genuinely entertaining cattle versus sheep western, watch director George Marshall's comedy western \"The Sheepman\" (1958) with Glenn Ford.\n",
      "Errol Flynn, as a sheep-herder? Say it ain't sew! No wonder Flynn drank his way through this turgid Western. I'd be pulling the wool over your eyes by saying Flynn doesn't mail it in. Lots of short scenes with many edits plus obvious studio cuts against outdoor backdrops. Flynn's first film in 1950 but the miles and trials were taking a toll on Errol. His eyes were too bloodshot to shoot some scenes.<br /><br />Nevertheless, the Technicolor cinematography (Calabasas Ranch)is first rate plus production values make up for the drab characters. It's tough to care about anyone except beautiful, flaming redhead, Alexis Smith. I've never seen whiter teeth in my life. Cute little scar on her chin too. Flynn and Smith have some nice scenes plus sing a fun little ditty: Reckon, I'm in love! Seriously, it's not bad! A sheep-herder invades cattle country! If this sounds like a bum steer of a film, you're probably right but it's Flynn in his final decade. He went downhill fast from here but \"amoung other things\", he still looks good next to Alexis.\n",
      "I think trashiness is a form of art, seriously. But trashy cinema is the kind of thing that needs to be done by someone who truly understands that this sub-genre requires hard work and great imagination. I'm convinced director Deodato has no clue of what I'm talking about. He wants to shock the audience but he commits a series of unpardonable mistakes that ruin material perfectly suited for what is fondly known as exploitation cinema. \"House On The Edge Of The Park\" has a strong cult following, but I found the film silly and boring. Sure, there is plenty of gratuitous nudity and violence here, but Deodato forgot a crucial element in the creation of trash: you have to be able to force the viewer to love their own feelings of inadequacy. The film simply never made me feel anything, negative or positive. I think the reason I found this movie so uninteresting is because you are never asked to identify with either the hunters or the prey. It is all so bland, so insipid, and seriously devoid of energy. Even the usually animated cult figure David Hess (who was better utilized by Wes Craven in the sleaze classic \"The Last House on the Left\"), looks bored. Don't be fooled by its reputation, this film is a big snooze.\n",
      "I really don't know what I expected going into this movie. After all, it's directed by Ruggero Deodato, the genius behind *Cannibal Holocost*. Here's the story in a nutshell: Hess, a rapist/killer, and Radice, his dimwit buddy, are two low-lifes who crash a high society party, and rape, torture, beat and humiliate everyone there.<br /><br />This movie really doesn't have much going for it. Hess is very scummy, and Radice...I don't know what his problem is. The rest of the cast, the victims, are fairly unlikeable, and are very difficult to sympathize with. If you're able to sit through 90 minutes of terribly depressing exploitation, you may enjoy the ending, but I suspect your finger will have pressed \"stop\" long before then. For Masochists Only.\n",
      "David Hess virtually replays his \"Last House on the Left\" role in this very bad Italian exploitation movie. He plays a perverted greaseball named Alex who spends his free time raping and strangling women. At the garage where he works, some snotty rich kids pull in to get their car worked on and Alex finds himself drawn to the attractive Lisa (Annie Belle), so he decides to follow them to a party, dragging along his retarded co-worker Ricky (Giavanni Lombardo Radice who frequently uses the Anglacized name John Morghen). Well at the party, it doesn't take long for Alex's bad side to come out as he proceeds to terrorize the people there. Some of the men are beaten, all of the women are stripped naked at one point or another and Alex tries to coerce Ricky into joining in on the fun. During one rape scene, the female \"victim\" seems like she could care less about it. There is ample opportunity for the party guests to turn the tables on their attackers, but it takes them forever to do so. It's very annoying to watch, but then there's one of those out-of-left-field endings that's supposed to justify why everyone acts brain dead throughout the entire movie. Sorry but I didn't buy it!<br /><br />I have no clue why this movie has a favorable score and reviews! It's just plain inept! Mostly terrible acting, cringe-worthy dialogue, completely unimaginative directing, almost no plot to speak of and that final twist I mentioned is so contrived and unlikely you'll want to smash the DVD when it's over with. The pluses are the photography is decent, the main theme song is sort of creepy, a couple of the actors were tolerable (namely Christian Borromeo and Lorraine De Selle, the rest of the cast either overacted or acted with all the enthusiasm of a tree stump) and it piles on full nudity and sexual scenes. There is really not much in the way of gore, but a lot of violence or sexually violent scenarios that might make it uncomfortable for some people to watch. I just found is ridiculous and amateurish; too badly made to really be effective or offensive.\n",
      "As a fan of extreme cinema, I decided to buy Cannibal Holocaust to see how far it truly goes. Although it cost £18.99, I decided to buy it anyway because I heard it also featured Deodato's other film House On The Edge Of The Park, a film which I had heard quite a bit of hype about. Having watched them both, I have to say that by comparison, Cannibal Holocaust felt like an absolute masterpiece. Normally, I can watch B-movies and even enjoy them, but HOTEOTP bored me to death. There is actually nothing of merit. The razor cuts looked like Biro marks. And as for the acting...it was like watching a porn movie without the porn (except for a few scenes...) I was expecting a whole lot but received so little. There seriously is no redeeming quality whatsoever, and I advise fans of shock films, horrors, thrillers or whatever other sub-genre this film has masqueraded as to steer well clear of this faecal abomination.\n",
      "First of all, let me say that I am just beginning to get my 'Italian Horror' cinema education so I'm still getting used to the unique aspects of the genre. This is my first Ruggero Deodato film (Next on my list to view is his 'Cannibal Holocaust' film). So far, vintage Italian horror has an obviously different tone indeed from vintage and especially new American horror in the way that there's an unnerving sense as one is watching (if you haven't seen the particular film before or many in the genre, like me!) that they're really going to push the envelope. Naw... make that TOTALLY cross the line with depicting extremely explicit violence and gore, breaking many American film taboos. I find many recent American horror films to have a tongue-and-cheek feel to them, making the blood and gore into an almost circus-like show. Villains are comical, shooting off these one-liners as they slay victims or vice versa. Plus, in Italian films, the action is usually accompanied by this bizarre dialogue and/or THAT CRAZY MUSIC. I gotta say, the two songs they use in this movie, especially the disco one, as cheesy-bad as they are, have been haunting me ever since. However, 'House on the Edge of the Park' didn't quite live up to my anxious expectation. I WAS very nervous and fearful throughout the first half of the film in not knowing what to expect after psycho Alex (David Hess) and his friend hit the party. But, surprisingly, it wasn't TOO horrible... not like I had expected anyway. First of all, there wasn't as much violent rape depiction as I thought there would be. I thought there would be women assaulted left and right. But I guess there's only so much harm two hoodlums can do. Aside from the rape at the beginning of the film, the two other sex scenes shown looked downright consensual(!)... even titillating. Lots of female nudity in this one, guys. Yet the scene with Alex and Cindy and his straight razor WAS pretty unsettling. The idea of being randomly sliced at with a razor definitely gives me the Hobie-jeebies. But most creepy to me was the was how the rest of the part guests just stood by and watched this happen to their friend for as long as they did. I thought the blond guy (Tom) was such a wimp! In fact, through most of the scenes at the house, the victimized guests all seem so passive, pretty much just allowing Alex and Ricky do what they wanted to do. To me, they just didn't seem scared or freaked out enough in the beginning when bad stuff started to happen. But I guess that is, again, all part of that unique \"tone\" with Italian horror that is so disarming.<br /><br />Perhaps the MOST interesting to me on the unrated DVD that I watched (the 'Shriek Show' edition) were the extras that include an interview with \"David Hess and Family.\" First of all, the interview is filmed very informally at what looks like the Hess home. I have no idea who the interviewer is, but his questions are heard on camera, which is very unusual. Amusingly, some of the interviewer's questions are somewhat pointless and tactless, in my opinion. This is especially evident when the interviewer tries to touch on the subject of David Hess' wife, Karoline Mardeck, also being in the film. Mr. Hess quickly shuts him down and in a somewhat menacing tone tells him something to the effect of, \"I thought I told you we weren't going to talk about that...\" Weird! After the David Hess interview, when his wife Karoline is being interviewed by herself, the interviewer tries to again bring up the subject of her being in the film and she just looks away uncomfortably saying \"I don't want to talk about it.\" Well, it's no wonder. Karoline Mardeck plays the girl that David Hess' character Alex rapes and kills in her car in the beginning of the film! Her name is Susan in the credits but I'm pretty sure I never heard her name uttered in the film. It's funny, because David Hess casually and openly discusses his relationship and interaction with the other actors in the film, but when it comes to talking about his wife's role in the film, he understandably becomes guarded. It's very awkward how they BOTH become so dismissive about it, like trying to deny it happened. But in a way, I have to say that I respect Mr. Hess for not wanting to talk about this degrading role his wife played in order to protect her/their privacy. I'm not sure if they were married at the time it was filmed, but in listening to Karoline recall during her interview how/when she and David met, it was on a plane to NYC in 1975 so it seems like they at least had been in some type of relationship for several years before this movie was filmed. In any case, I'm sure that's the LAST thing any married couple would want to talk about--how one sexually brutalized the other on film for all posterity. Amid all the sexploitation and violence surrounding this film, that was a humanizing aspect that comforted me in a strange way. What I also got from the interview is that David Hess, although strange, is a pretty deep and real guy with some interesting insights into the characters he's played and the movies he's made. Plus, the fact that he's had a fairly successful career as a musician (even composing songs for his other notorious horror flick, 'Last House on the Left') makes him even more intriguing as an actor and person.<br /><br />As for 'House on the Edge of the Park,' I only recommend if you are a fan of the Italian horror genre, sexploitation films, and of course, David A. Hess.\n",
      "To call LA CASA SPERDUTA NEL PARCO (a.k.a. HOUSE ON THE EDGE OF THE PARK) trash would be an insult to trash. Comparing it to Wes Craven's LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT would be an insult to that not-so-great film, as well. Even writing a review of it requires more energy than it deserves, but I'm going to anyway, so potential viewers will be forewarned and forearmed.<br /><br />\"PLOT\" SYNOPSIS: The \"plot\" basically is a synopsis: A pair of thugs are invited to a soiree at the titular abode, and wreak havoc for most of the 91-minute running time, raping, maiming, and just generally being bad buggers. <br /><br />Leading the circus of bad behaviour is Alex, a boorish garage mechanic whose idea of consensual sex is raping young women at razor's point, and his dopey sidekick Ricky, who meekly follows wherever Alex goes, and does pretty much everything Alex tells him to do. This includes the aforementioned treachery at the party, easily the most unpleasant party ever captured on film, and that's before all the bad stuff happens. There are no characters in this film, only bad actors wearing bad costumes, spewing dialogue so bad it rarely even approaches unintentional comedy (although there are mercifully a few moments of that, as well). <br /><br />It is clear what the filmmakers were trying to do: shock and disturb the audience. The only thing shocking and disturbing about the film is that it was ever made in the first place. Implausible from the get-go, with wretched dialogue (\"It's too late to boogie\") and abysmal performances, especially the lead, David A. Hess, who looks like the love child of Tom Jones and Telly Savalas, and who tries to chew the scenery, but only manages to bite. When he tries to be scary, he's almost funny, and when he tries to be funny, he's just scary. His performance wants to be over-the-top, but in the end, just wants. Why anyone would invite him to a party is a good indication of the collective I.Q. of the partiers, who pretty much deserve everything that happens to them, because they clearly outnumber their captors, and have ample opportunities to disarm and even disembowel them, but blithely allow Alex to terrorize them in lots of nasty ways. <br /><br />*SPOILER* Their acquiescence is explained in easily one of the dumbest \"twist\" endings you're likely to see. *END SPOILER*<br /><br />What else can be said about a party no one would want to attend, peopled by characters no one would ever want to meet? To call the film dreary would be too complimentary. It is a waste of celluloid, with all the style and substance of a 70s home movie, ninety minutes you will never get back, and the only thing you may take away from the experience is the dubious pleasure of giving this turkey a vote of 1.\n",
      "This movie is so bad, but has the right elements to cause a cult following. Two psychopathic garage mechanics, Alex(David Hess)and Ricky(Giovanni Radice), invite themselves to a party of social climbing snobbish types. This 'with-it' crowd, begin taunting and making fun of this low life duo without knowing the mayhem to come. Alex and his mentally challenged friend decide to have their own brand of fun and take everyone hostage and begin humiliating, torturing and raping for their own amusement. But how is it that a group of people are threatened by one straight razor? Alas...there is a twist; the two tormentors don't realize that they have actually been set up as the guest have their own agenda. Other cast members: Annie Belle, Christian Borromeo, Brigitte Petronio and Lorraine De Selle. Redeeming, no way. Worth watching, kinda.\n",
      "I noticed the IMDB give the title of this movie as EDIE & PEN where as in Britain it`s called DESERT GAMBLE which is a far more exciting title . What does a movie named DESERT GAMBLE conjure up to you ? A war film set in the North African campaign of 1942 ? A heist movie of likable geezers going to Vegas to rip off the mob ? Or perhaps even a disaster movie about a plane crashing into the Sahara . Nothing as exciting as that happens in this film so I guess EDIE & PEN is a more accurate title since it doesn`t really conjure up anything <br /><br />And nothing really happens in the movie either , it`s basically a low concept dialogue driven chick flick about two women who meet in a red neck bar , one of whom has a sort of relationship with a red neck and the two women swap life stories . I guess girls who are not expecting too much might enjoy it and it is very inoffensive but that`s hardly massive praise\n",
      "I lived in Reno for 18 years and was there when this movie was filmed. I had no idea it was being filmed and believe me Reno is the Biggest Little City in the World, and if a movie is being filmed there it's almost impossible to not know. Yet, I had no idea this was going on. The concept of the story is reasonable, but the concept is all that is delivered. All the fluff story propped up around the concept just is not good. Scott Glen seems to be just about the level of a leering drunk and how Pen \"falls\" for him is just not apparent. Jennifer Tilly is lovely and carries her part very well, but Scott Glen and Stockard Channing's characters require more script quality before they could be held responsible for the out come. (Bad writing can not be overcome by the best of them.) As I watched I saw them drive from the Hilton to the Airport through downtown and rolled my eyes at the director's ploy to present Reno's bright lights as window dressing. If you don't know Reno, all is OK and the director's trick is well received.\n",
      "To put it simply: a lack of respect. GAME OF DEATH: THE ROBERT CLOUSE VERSION ranks (in two senses of the word) right alongside Ed Wood's PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE. Clouse and Wood weren't the first graverobbers on the scene, to be sure, but they both came away from the boneyard with unclean hands. Like Burke and Hare, they was just lookin' to pocket some loose change. Which they did. Nor were they alone. Years after the fact, DRAGON: THE BRUCE LEE STORY (based, we're told, on Clouse's own book) would come along and reopen the old wound(s). Like most Bruce Lee fans, I suffered through the seemingly endless exploitation cycle that began the moment he died. It wasn't easy, because not a single one of the purported bioflix came anywhere near the Truth. DRAGON likewise created its own distorted \"reality,\" with yet another wannabe look-alike choreographed through yet more over-the-top, badly done fight scenes that did nothing more than add yet another layer of tarnish to the memory of a man who deserves better. GAME OF DEATH is an insult to the intelligence. Now that we have BRUCE LEE: A WARRIOR'S JOURNEY, there's no need to even go back and revisit this one.\n",
      "This was the film Bruce Lee was working on when he died. He had stopped working on this film to work on Enter the Dragon and never had the chance to come back and finish this. The good news is that Lee shot a good 30 minutes worth of footage for Game of Death. The bad news is Robert Clouse came around and tried to make an entire film leading up to the Bruce Lee footage that was shot including Bruce Lee look-a-likes and cardboard cut-outs. The entire film is pretty awful since the story is lame and the acting is over dramatic. I'm surprised Sammo Hung agreed to be a part of this at all. The archived footage of Bruce Lee just seems forced and thrown in to try and make a buck while the actual footage of Lee's funeral just feels tasteless and inconsiderate. Clouse would unfortunately give birth to something that would spawn many films including Bruce Lee clones starring the likes of Bruce Li. The actual Bruce Lee footage is some of his best, but is shown in its entirety in the documentary A Warrior's Journey included in the special edition of Enter the Dragon. If you're a Bruce Lee fan, don't waste your time with this. Stick to the films he actually completed and watch A Warrior's Journey to see the reconstruction of Lee's intended cut of this film.\n",
      "I think Game of Death shouldn't have went ahead with it's release, Bruce Lee would've been disappointed in it as towards the end of the film after fighting Hikim, you could obviously see that it was no longer Bruce playing the part of Billy Lo and it must've been a kid or someone drunk editing that scene showing Bruce with candles and a punch bag behind him and when it cut to his replacement, there was nothing behind him. The director of this film probably just went ahead with the release to make money and people that are fans of Bruce's work, including his family, must've been left disappointed as well, I certainly was.\n",
      "I would have preferred that they never made it as it is such a mess. I do wonder though what they could do with todays special effects and computer graphics? If anyone had never seen a Bruce Lee film and then saw this, they would wonder what all the fuss was about. Even some of the footage used was probably not the final scenes Bruce would have used. He was very good at camera angles and editing and this film falls flat on both those counts. There was also much more footage available that never made it into this film, just why I do now know (Check out the documentary called 'Bruce Lee: A Warriors Journey' and you will see more action that was meant for this film.) It would have been better to have never made Game of Death and most Bruce fans have it simply to fast forward to seeing the parts that he was actually in.\n",
      "A masterwork of exploitation and grave robbery worthy of the late Edward D. Wood Jr. Approximately 11 minutes of footage of the late Bruce Lee, including film of his funeral and his body in his coffin, are used to sell a movie about a supposedly dead actor avenging himself after being killed' for not paying protection to organised crime. There's an uncomfortable echo of the death of Brandon Lee when Lee's character dies' after someone replaces a blank in the gun that shoots him for a stunt sequence with a real bullet. If they'd used all the real footage of Lee either before or after this, the film would have made much more sense: instead, they used alleged look-alikes, their faces sometimes hidden by false beards or motorcycle helmets, intercut with close-ups of the real Lee. If you're a martial arts fan, fast-forward to the climactic fight scenes; if you're not, the only possible reasons to see this movie are (i) Colleen Camp's cleavage and (ii) the sheer ghoulish awfulness of this barely animated corpse.\n",
      "I recently bought the DVD - Game of Death (Special Edition) which features 3hrs of bonus footage. Release in 93 it features the original film which is poor (I gave it 4/10) but shows 40+ minutes of Bruce Lee in action in the Pagoda.<br /><br />What is clear from this is that Game of Death as Bruce Lee wanted would have<br /><br />been a totally different film. Instead of one man (Bruce) fighting his way up the pagoda, there are 3. Bruce demonstrates the versatility of his fighting method against a series of exponents in his unique style. Any fan of martial arts will find this footage riveting. Also on the DVD are interviews with Dan Inosanto, the stick and nunchak<br /><br />exponent, and George Lazenby, plus bios of the other characters in the pagoda. Dan Inosanto also gives a Jeet Kune Do clinic.\n",
      "I was very annoyed after watching this film.<br /><br />I am a huge Bruce Lee fan, and this film would've been the best film ever in my opinion if it wasn't for Bruce Lee's very unfortunate death. The original story line was that Bruce Lee's wife and daughter get kidnapped (his character's wife and daughter), and to rescue them, Bruce Lee would have to fight up a temple - which has five floors - fighting an expert on a particular martial arts form on each floor.<br /><br />However, this film is very disrespectful, because it shows real footage of Bruce Lee's funeral - including his actual dead body - just to further the plot of the story, which is the lead character (who is meant to be Bruce Lee) faking his death.<br /><br />This film would have receieved a -10/10 if it was not for Bruce Lee's excellent fight scenes at the end, so this film therefore receives a 3/10. The fight scenes at the end are 10/10 though, just a shame they did not have all the original footage until recently e.g. the knun-chuck fight Bruce Lee has.<br /><br />\n",
      "Bruce Lee stars as Billy Lo, an action star (of the martial arts variety) who mobsters are trying to force to sign with them, however after taking a couple of beatings and an assassination attempt, Lo fakes his death, has reconstructive surgery and looks to teach the mobsters what the meaning of \"No\" is. Game Of Death is Bruce Lee's worst movie. This is an obvious truth. In terms of quality Game Of Death is sometimes even lower than Bruce Le or Bruce Li's movies. The sequence where Bruce Lee's face is pasted over the mirror (As others have mentioned) is truly as shoddy as it gets and overall the movie has a few alright action sequences in the beginning but it's all very sub-par stuff. That is until Bruce Lee takes on Danny Inasanto and Kareem Abdoul Jabbar and of course which boosts its rating into low mediocrity. Also of notice (Though it's all blatantly obvious even to those who have never seen a Bruce Lee movie) is the use of a stand in, in which the stand in wears sunglasses, bandage over his face, an old man's costume and of course a hilariously bad fake beard. All of this is laced with Bruce Lee footage from his earlier movies. Usually to a closeup of Lee stock footage then followed by the stunt double's back. In other words this is a very badly made movie but what makes it worth watching at least on a genre level is the climax which is awesome in its crispness and pace. In fact the only thing that leaves an impression on one after watching this, is how much better Lee's original version would've easily been had he lived to complete it because as we know Robert Clouse added 90% new footage and made it into what we got here. Still worth a look for die hard fans (Like me) who will watch anything with Bruce Lee. Because of the awesome climax Game Of Death earns mediocrity the same way an A+ on a test would bring a grade of a D+ up to a C-.<br /><br />* * out of 4-(Fair)\n",
      "People whom have called this film \"fun\" are basically saying that they wouldn't mind if someone ripped apart their final work and turned it into one of the worst movies of all time, only saved by those who enjoy it for being entertaining. I'm sorry to say that this is the most disrespectful work I have ever seen, basically it's liking digging up a corpse and putting it on strings. Maybe I was just to loyal of a fan to the great one, because I can't watch this without turning it off. Those who like it, have somehow found a vehicle to ride where this seems to be entertaining. I picked up the Enter the Dragon 2 DISC DVD, and if you want the fighting footage from GOD, it's in there. So basically this film has no use anymore, and hopefully people stop watching it.<br /><br />The buzz on this film from my idiot friends continued to tell me that this film was \"good\", so I believed them. I had seen the four main Lee films (Chinese Connection, Way of the Dragon, Big Boss and Enter the Dragon) a bunch of times, and wondered why this guy hadn't been mentioned to me earlier. I popped it in and was completely struck with a brick of hatred for this piece of crap. Horrible EVERYTHING is the only phrase I knew of this, and how people could take this for entertainment is beyond me.<br /><br />Bruce is still the greatest martial artist whom has ever lived. His presence alone made him the martial arts genre worldwide, he was truly a man before his time. But to see something like this that just pains me every time I see it, it just shouldn't exist. Anybody who likes this film like a \"Mystery Science Theater kind of way\" should be destroyed. Hopefully this craptastic waste of time is forgotten and people destroyed for ever liking this film.\n",
      "Movie tells the story of Billy Lo, a famous Kung fu action star that is being bullied into joining a syndicate. He eventually takes them all out. Game of Death is truly one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Bruce Lee was used in this film only for someone to gain profit. He is only in the last 10 to 20 minutes with a few cuts here and there. As others have already mentioned that was all that he had filmed years before and they decided to use stock footage and other actors to fill in the rest of the move....... about 90% of it! Most of the time you have an actor dressed up with hair in his eyes and large glasses like the kind wives where when the get beaten, to cover up that its not Bruce Lee. The fights scenes are laughable garbage, not good, but very funny dew the over dramatic wah ta stuff. Lee's battles at the end are the only redeemable part of this movie and you should skip most of the movie to retain your brain matter. Besides for Lee most of the people in this movie are in poor shape and it surprises me that any of them ever got into any kind of gym whatsoever. Bruce lee is rolling in his grave over this one. 2 out 10 for this bomb.\n",
      "I rate this movie a 2 out of 10, two points for having a cool ending credits where they show clips of the real Bruce Lee while a sad tune plays in the background. Other than that this movie is pure junk, most of the movie is played by a Bruce Lee double whose moves aren't as graceful as Bruce Lee's. The story and the dialogue seemed like it was written in five days. Another thing that annoyed me is in one scene they pasted a picture of Bruce Lee's face over the Bruce Lee double with the worst editing I have ever seen. This movie will trick you, because the DVD cover has Bruce Lee's picture on it when it's not even a Bruce Lee movie. This movie shouldn't be worth more than five US dollars.\n",
      "What did Golden Harvest Studios get when they spliced fifteen minutes of Bruce Lee demo footage onto a clumsy, poorly-written mess full of Mafia heavies, motorcycle-riding thugs, and faded Hollywood stars like Gig Young and Dean Jagger? Well, it's not a Bruce Lee movie, but it *is* called \"Game of Death\"(the title Lee had intended to use for a totally different film before he died). And it's a disaster. Not only are there two unconvincing doubles(Kim Tai-chung and Chen Yao-po) who stand in for Lee, but there's even an equally unconvincing Kareem Abdul Jabbar double! That's right, Lee's student and friend wisely chose to have nothing to do with this humiliating bastard of a project, and--like Lee--appears only in the climactic fight footage. Speaking of that footage(in which Lee also takes on student/instructor/nunchaku expert Dan Inosanto and hapkido master Ji Han Jae), it was shot immediately before work on \"Enter the Dragon\" began and obviously was not intended to be used in the final \"Game of Death\" project. It's interesting to watch, but it is ONLY demonstration footage; the choreography has a lot of rough edges. (Watch John Little's \"Bruce Lee: A Warrior's Journey\" to see the footage placed in its proper perspective.) The rest of the fights in the film are not up to the standard of Lee's demos, of course. The locker room showdown between Kim Tai-chung and Bob Wall is okay, but if director Robert Clouse wanted to fool the audience into believing that the protagonist in this fight was Bruce Lee(and he obviously did, judging from all the split-second reaction clips of Lee from other films that were spliced into \"Game of Death\", both during the Bob Wall fight and elsewhere), he failed miserably. This is a rotten piece of work, people. And I repeat, it is NOT a Bruce Lee movie! In his definitive article on the Bruceploitation phenomenon in \"Martial Arts Movies\" magazine back in the eighties, Daniel Lee included \"Game of Death\" in his filmography of Bruce Lee exploitation flicks, and he was right--that's exactly where it belongs. This movie is an insult to Lee's memory and, thankfully, most fans now seem to recognize it as such. Single worst moment: about five minutes into the film, when a picture of Lee's face is pasted to a mirror, and the neck and shoulders of one of the doubles are placed immediately beneath the photo. \"Hey, look!\", the viewer is supposed to say(apparently). \"There's Bruce Lee!\" Groooaaannnnn...how cheap can you get? And no, Chuck Norris is not in \"Game of Death\", so why does his name appear in the credits?! EVERYTHING about this movie is terrible, and not in a so-bad-it's-good way. AVOID!\n",
      "Let me explain the above comment. In the horrible movie PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE, writer/director Ed Wood, Jr. incorporated some footage he'd shot of Bela Lugosi just before Bela's death. While the footage had nothing to do with the script for PLAN 9, Wood decided to \"cleverly\" use this film and hash out Lugosi's role by having a much taller guy (a dentist by the way) hold a cape over his face in all the Lugosi scenes not available in the original reel of footage! The result, not surprisingly, is horrid. Now all of the reason for PLAN 9 being named the worst movie ever made wasn't all due to the Lugosi footage, but it was one of the main factors contributing to the pure crappiness of the film.<br /><br />In the case of GAME OF DEATH, some initial footage had been shot back in 1972 but was temporarily shelved in order to finish another Lee film. But, Lee's untimely death left about 30 or 40 minutes of unusable footage. So, the studio big-shots decided to \"pull an Ed Wood\" and use the old footage and write an entire movie around it--using extras and irrelevant footage to make a \"coherent\" film. Well, the result wasn't great but at least it was a good bit better than PLAN 9! As far as integrating a dead guy into a movie, the results were often pretty pathetic. Now I am NOT saying they shouldn't have made the movie. Instead, they should have just admitted that they were using a double and not even bothered trying to fool the audience--it just wasn't possible! Having an extra wearing sunglasses inside and out just looked stupid and playing the part straight, without stupid tricks, would have been better. A couple other stupid \"tricks\" they tried to make a coherent film included cutting closeup shots of Lee into scenes where he obviously wasn't acting! His clothes and the backgrounds just didn't match the double! The worst case was near the beginning when Lee was supposedly almost killed by a falling light. The close up was of the Real Lee--standing outside against a brick wall. But, the scene was filmed INSIDE and there was no brick wall! This was true Ed Wood editing!!! Even worse was one scene where they literally pasted Lee's face over another person's face for a very brief scene! Clutch Cargo episodes were constructed better than this! Probably the creepiest aspect of all this was that Bruce's son, Brandon, also died prematurely while filming THE CROW and the studio did pretty much the same trick (though with modern computer techniques it did look better). In addition, to add another creepier element, Brandon was killed in an on-set accident where he was killed by a prop gun---something that is in the plot of GAME OF DEATH--when a bad guy pretends to be using a prop gun but really shoots Bruce in the face!!!! This is just so surreal and sick. Also surreal and sick is seeing Gig Young in his final film--just months before he killed himself and his partner! This truly seemed like a cursed production! While I am trashing the film, I may as well point out a few other things before I actually go on to praise the film. First, while I greatly enjoyed watching Chuck Norris BRIEFLY at the beginning of the film, somebody should have told him to shave his back hair!!! Chuck just looked like some sort of missing link with all that hair--a major turn off and something I am surprised made it into both this film and another Lee picture, RETURN OF THE DRAGON. Second, the female co-star Colleen Camp very ably sang the final song in the film but when they show her singing earlier in the movie, she's obviously out of sync with the music.<br /><br />Now apart from the MANY serious flaws with the film, let's talk about the good. While a tad cheesy, the overall production values were pretty good (apart from the way they dealt with Lee)--especially for a kung-fu movie. Seeing the American supporting actors (especially a foul-mouthed elderly Dean Jagger) was pretty interesting and the music for the film was exceptional. The opening titles were highly reminiscent of a James Bond film and the recurring strains throughout the film were very clearly inspired by the music from ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE. Plus, the effects and fight scenes were pretty good throughout.<br /><br />Despite occasionally seeing tiny glimpses of Lee in the first 2/3 of the film, he is the clear star of the final portion of the film--the only portion of the movie that should have included Lee in my opinion. Here, he does perhaps his best stunt-work ever and the battles are well worth seeing for fans of the genre. In particular, seeing Lee fight Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was majorly cool. It really is a shame that such great material was never used the way it was originally intended. For fans of Lee, this is STILL a must-see film, but for most others it's a mixed bag--a lot of good and a lot of really, really, REALLY bad editing.<br /><br />FYI--In the wonderful kung fu comedy, SHAOLIN SOCCER, the goalie is clearly meant to look and act just like Bruce Lee. In fact, his yellow outfit is a copy of Lee's in the finale of GAME OF DEATH. This was a cute little homage to Lee.\n",
      "Like many I thought this was a waste of some very good talent. I hope that this doesn't mean that these people are on their way down the proverbial ladder and will have to sink into the gutter with more trash like this. I expected so much more and am very disappointed. Hindsight now tells me I should have waited for the Video a few years from now and saved a few bucks. But then maybe in a few years you won't even be able to find it on the shelves<br /><br />IMHO I rate it 3/10\n",
      "This \"comedy\" is awful. It is boring. Good actors making fools of themselves appearing in this awful movie. There was nothing funny in this movie. Jokes are awful and the plot is junk also... Avoid this movie at all costs. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. Depressing...\n",
      "I rented The Crew (2000) with my family and could not even finish watching the whole thing, and it was only 88 minutes long! Director Michael Dinner needs to stick to TV. Voice overs worked great in The Wonder Years (tv show) but I don't need a voice over for the first 45 minutes of any movie. This movie was a brainless and pathetic attempt at humor. This movie was not funny, nor thought provoking, and really is a complete waste of time. Its not that it was just not funny, it was actually annoying, aggravating, and painful to watch. I give this movie a two, which is 100% mark-up for what it really deserves just because of the cinematography, set design, and editing. Enough said. This movie was AWFUL!!\n",
      "Let me see...old retirees/former gangsters decide to reform the crew. Sounds great to me. What doesn't sound great is the way they handled this potentially hilarious premise. I can't say I hated this movie, because I did get quite a few chuckles, but no real laughs. And when you see a cast including Burt Reynolds and Richard Dreyfuss you can't help but feel cheated when it doesn't live up to the hype. First of all, the trailers are misleading. And the poster of the whole crew--Dreyfuss, Reynolds, Seymour Cassel and Dan Hedaya--in gangster suits and hats is as well. Because we hardly ever get to see them get into action, mob-wise. In the first act, we're bombarded with senior citizen stereotypes: getting to a restaurant in time for free soup, ogling young women, having weak bladders, playing Bingo, etc. In other words, it goes for pretty cheap pay-offs. The four leads look more like caricatures of senior citizens than actual senior citizens. Everything in this movie is mediocre, except the acting. Some critics felt the movie was trying too hard; I felt it was trying too little. The plot, however, is overwrought. We're stuck with one preposterous situation after another, and they all somehow interlock. In a funnier movie, I would've excused that--but in this one...the plot was a distraction. Just like how we're stuck with old people stereotypes, we're stuck with Cuban stereotypes, with a bunch of \"Scarface\" wannabes. That didn't work out too well either. Despite the great cast, I would not suggest renting this movie. Though it's not bad, there's so much unocovered potential that you just want to yell out your ideas to the director. The cast deserves better and we deserve better.\n",
      "Ugh. What a disappointment. A great line-up: Dannie Hedaya, Big Burt Reynolds, Seymour Cassel, Richard Dreyfuss and even Lainie Kazan; an excellent premise for hilarity: a bunch of retired wise-guys...and no story. It just falls apart like one of those cartoon characters that's been hit in the head with a falling anvil: first, the head, then an arm, then..., well, you know. Dang! it's too stinking bad as I wanted, really wanted to see some funny business out of this array of talent-- but, even the best acting \"Crew\" can't pull it off with no story. The first reviewer here remarked on the retiree stereotypes and the gags wear thin, thin after the first run through. The plot (?) doesn't hold and it goes down, down. Bummer. I don't like to dis a film, especially with a \"Crew\" of guys that I've enjoyed in other films, but this one is a stinker and we will just have to let it go. Bummer again. I was up for some good comedy.\n",
      "Italian-American ethnic humor, and similar mafia-based spoofs are pretty passe by now, wouldn't you think? Even so, a clever, interesting, and especially a FUNNY movie is always watchable, even if not a hit. This could have been an \"OK\" flick. This movie, however, is a dreadful, horrible, depressing pile of junk. It is mean spirited, ugly, and worse than a waste of film-- it is a bummer and a downer. The only surprise here is how a group of talented and likeable movie stars such as Burt Reynolds, Dan Hedaya, and Richard Dreyfus, to name the ones I remember, got themselves hooked into doing this. Did they owe someone in Hollywood a lot of money, and this was the pay-back? Did they lose a bet? What? I had to walk out of the theater after half an hour it was so bad.<br /><br />Avoid this movie at all costs. I gave this a 1 out of 10. If we could give negative numbers, this trash would have gotten a minus three.\n",
      "Why did I headline this review with that comment? Because it gives you an idea on how this movie is, it should have been called \"The Crud\" because that is all I got out of this piece of junk. It looks like a version of \"Grumpy Old Goodfellas\" except GRUMPY OLD MEN was funny and GOODFELLAS was excellent drama, THE CREW comes nowhere near those film for quality. Back in the 1960's four men were making the big bucks back in New Jersey (all the gangsters come from either New York or New Jersey, it's in the mobster film rule book). Then come the year 2000, the four men have aged and are now living in Miami Beach with a good view of the ocean. There's the leader Bobby Bartellemeo (Richard Dreyfuss), the short temper Joey \"Bats\" Pistella (Burt Reynolds), Mike the Brick (Dan Hedaya), and Tony \"the Mouth\" Donato (Seymor Cassel). The retirement complex that these men live in is losing the old and bringing in the young (because they love the ocean view). So these four men decide to fake a murder so every youning would move out. The problem is the already dead body is the father of a short temper drug lord (Miguel Sandoval). And when Tony's girlfriend, Ferris, (a voluptuous Jennifer Tilly) who is a stripper ask the men to \"wack\" her step-mother (Lainie Kazan), all chaos breaks loose. And there is also a sub-plot with two police detectives (Carrie Anne Moss and Jeremy Piven) who are investigating the murder. This movie will have the senior citizens laugh so hard that their dentures will keep falling out. But for those under the age of 50, will find this film boring, tedious, and slow. The only way this is some what watchable for men is looking at the beautiful body of Jennifer Tilly, which has improved since her BULLETS OVER BROADWAY days. As for the women, I can't think of anything that will appeal to them, so they'll probably fall asleep. The acting in this is bad bad bad, Richard Dreyfuss who can be a great actor (look at MR. HOLLAND'S OPUS) is doing his routine comic role, similar to KRIPPENDORF'S TRIBE. Burt Reynolds who is also good (look at BOOGIE NIGHTS) is a comic prop used in this film getting wacked on the head and having his head dunked in the toilet. Dan Hedaya keeps commenting on his \"art work\" on his deceased bodies he fixes up at the morgue that he works at. But it's Seymor Cassel who I found to be the most enjoyable of the four. One: he barely talks at all, so he doesn't have anything stupid to say, unlike Dreyfuss, Reynolds, and Hedaya. Two: when he does have something to say, it's always more enjoyable than anyone else in the film. Carrie Anne Moss who was full of energy in THE MATRIX is sleep-walking in this film. Jeremy Piven who can be enjoyable is more annoying. And Lainie Kazan gets the award for the most annoying character in the film as the Jewish step-mother of Jennifer Tilly's character. Besides Cassel, Miguel Sandoval has a few bits of good lines also (especially on his description on Seymor Cassel's appearance). But does that save the film, hell no! It's so silly and brainless that you wonder how a bad director like Dinner got a talented cast like this. My guess is that Dinner made a bet that SAVING PRIVATE RYAN wouldn't win the Best Picture Oscar. And what is the talented Barry Sonnenfield doing producing this bomb. He's always bringing out good products, GET SHORTY, MEN IN BLACK, and even WILD WILD WEST! From my guess, the only way that THE CREW is going to make any money this weekend is: 1.) People will get it confused with THE CELL, since they have the same count of letters. Or 2.)<br /><br />People will get it confused with another film with four old men getting back into action, SPACE COWBOYS. SPACE COWBOYS had wit, charm, and even excitement, THE CREW doesn't have any of that. If you want to see a great film with four old timers getting back into action, go see SPACE COWBOYS. And if you already seen SPACE COWBOYS, go see it again. Save yourself from this witless and pointless travesty which calls itself a comedy. *1/2 (out of five)\n",
      "What a waste of time. I got in for free, went in with very minimal expectations (I expected a mobbed-up version of Space Cowboys), and still left the theater aghast at the pointlessness of this movie.<br /><br />What I got was a comedy with NO laughs (okay, one very small one), a plot seemingly written on a napkin (by a drunk whose seen Goodfellas too many times), and probably the worst performances in the careers of every person in this movie.<br /><br />I expected a lot more from the writer of my favorite comedy movie (Kingpin) and sitcom (Rich Jeni's Platypus Man), but I guess Barry Fanaro ran out of ideas a long time ago. Aside from The Whole Nine Yards, not coincidentally another supposed \"mob comedy\", this is the worst movie I've seen in the last 10 years.<br /><br />Please, I beg of you, don't see this movie, you will thank me.\n",
      "I saw this movie on a flight to Florida...and I turned it off. There was nothing else to do...but I turned it off. It was awful! It really is a shame b/c the idea had great potential...the script was poorly written, poorly executed and just plain boring! It was like the Talented Mr Ripley...I kept waiting and waiting for it to get better...until the wait became excruciating!! LOL Take a pass on this one\n",
      "The Crew. What a waste of talent. Has every movie maker in Hollywood forgot how to write a screen play? The plot makes no sense from start to finish. The audience I was with laughed at the inconsistent plot that had so many holes it seemed like they randomly spliced parts from five different movies together.<br /><br />How dare they take $7 dollars from me for this trash. I now vow never, never, never to spend my $7 on a movie without a rating of 7 or above from this site.\n",
      "THE CREW / (2000) * (out of four)<br /><br />Michael Dinner's new mob parody, \"The Crew,\" just isn't funny. It is as plain and simple as that. The movie is so engrossed in its concepts that it forgets the concepts are not what make people laugh, but the execution of those concepts. Various humors contained within the film provide one-liners and visual sight gags evolving from age, death, sex, and testosterone, not many that are effective. While I enjoyed Michael Dinner's direction style and some of the nifty camera angles, he fails miserably on bringing inspiration to the production. \"The Crew\" is one of the worst comedies of the year.<br /><br />The film takes place in South Beach, Miami, where four old men are about to be evicted from their apartment due to rising rent costs. Little does the landlord know, however, the senior citizens used to be slick, wiseguy criminals Bobby Bartellemro (Richard Dreyfuss), Joey \"Bats\" Pistella (Burt Reynolds), Mike \"The Brick\" Donatelli (Dan Hedaya) and Tony \"The Mouth\" Donato. These guys are beginning to realize life is passing them by and plan to concoct a scheme to place them in their past shoes. <br /><br />The movie has little development of anything. The characters, who are potentially interesting, are introduced with short, specific scenes featuring each in a disjointed incidence in which they react to; their various behaviors are what portray their personalities. Because of the lack of decent prefaces, the character's intentions are unclear throughout the story. Thus the story struggles to pull itself through a brief running time that feels much longer than it is. The producers seemingly inject sight gags along the way for commercial appearance, and the ones that are funny already have been milked to death in TV ads and theatrical trailers.<br /><br />\tBobby, Joey, Mike, and Tony come up with an idea to save their home. They steal a body from the local morgue, blow its head off with a shotgun, and leave it in the lobby of their hotel, thus the seemingly murderous event will lower the popularity of the hotel and keep the rent in check.<br /><br />\tSeveral other key characters come into play. There is a South American drug lord named Raul Ventanna (Miguel Sandoval), who thinks someone's trying to send him a threatening message, ex-lovers and detectives Olivia Neal (Carrie-Anne Moss) and Steve Menteer (Jeremy Piven) who are investigating the homicide and believe the old men to be potential suspects, and a local prostitute/stripper, Ferris (Jennifer Tilly), who blackmails the four guys into murdering her stepmother, Pepper (Lainie Kazan).<br /><br />\tThe plot is not interesting or engaging mainly because I never cared about any of the unexplained characters. This is the kind of movie in which the ideas are potentially amusing, but the implementation of those ideas are accomplished quite poorly. The plot is frustrating, injecting stale contrivances like an estranged relationship between a father and daughter that feels trite and boring. This movie is like a lacking \"Mafia\" with a third of the energy. <br /><br />\tIn a movie as deprived as \"The Crew\" an inquisitive audience member anxiously awaits the conclusion, not only because they are overcome with pleasure that the pitiful waste of time is finally over, but also because the ending usually brings a sense of accomplishment to a production, regardless of how horrible. However, that sense of accomplishment is also absent from \"The Crew.\" This film's ending resolves itself in a fashion that is entirely unconvincing and abstract. If you are looking for a funny movie about old men doing things out of their league, go see the funny and poignant \"Space Cowboys\": a movie that shows just how horrible this one is.<br /><br />\n",
      "The only really good thing I can say about this movie is that it inspired me to re-read the book. The book had some scenes that would have made wonderful cinema such as the interogation of a murder suspect who gleefully confesses to the committing the crime but claims to have used a rifle instead of a knife, the surprise reception for Chee at his first session as a healer, the discovery of the true identity of the shotgun artist, Leaphorn's rescue of Chee that unintentionally delivers him into the hands of the real murderer, and the ironic circumstances that rescue Chee for the second time. What was the reason for discarding these potentialy terrific moments and replacing them with a script that was almost on the same level as the type of Hollywood TV detective series that gets justifiably canceled in its first season?<br /><br />Some other elements from the book that were missing or barely noticeable in the movie include the thrill of Chee being able to prove himself to the legendary Leaphorn, the intricate convergence of both detectives towards the same suspect from different evidence, Leaphorn's map, the evidence of how some Navajo endure the hassle of nearly impassable roads in order to live in locations of isolation and visual splendor, and of course the original method used by the murderer to commit his crimes.<br /><br />Perhaps someday America will produce a mystery series on par with the best that England has to offer. Tony Hillerman's novel are certainly the proper raw material for such an endeavour, but to me this movie is a major irritant as I can not help seeing how it squanders the opportunity to have created something truly excellent.\n",
      "Robert Redfords PBS \"Mystery\" adaptations of Tony Hillerman's Navajo police novels completely ruins the two main characters, Jim Chee and Joe Leaphorn. Chee in the books was a regular guy who also happened to be deeply involved in his people's culture, to the point of learning to be a \"singer\" or healer. In the films he is already an expert on all things spiritual, the mystical Indian stereotype who has no real personality, no faults to speak of, no doubts about anything, no insecurities. In Hillerman's books, Joe Leaphorn was a \"legendary detective\" who was also a highly educated scholar, at least as if not much more knowledgeable about Navajo and Native American culture and religion than Chee. But though Leaphorn knew about it all, he didn't live it in the mystical sense, not being particularly religious himself. Leaphorn's god was logic and a belief that everything that happens, happens for a reason. In these crappy movies, poor Wes Studi's version of Leaphorn has been made into a man who knows virtually nothing about his own culture, doomed to be forever \"educated\" by the know it all mystic man Chee. This makes Chee ever superior, which is very ironic, because in the books, Chee always feels vastly inferior to Leaphorn because of his much greater police knowledge, education, and experience. And it was this part of the relationship that made their two characters so interesting when thrown together.<br /><br />Producer Robert Redford took two fairly complex characters (by paperback mystery novel standards) and mooshed 'em down into nothing but two more Indian stereotypes.<br /><br />Redford's first effort to adapt Hillerman (which his company now tries to pretend never existed) was Errol Morris's \"The Dark Wind.\" While that flick was no masterpiece, it was head and feet above these slow, dumbed down TV movies.\n",
      "I grew up on the Navajo Nation, and right away in the first 30 minutes I see that the movie was filmed over 200 miles away from the Navajo Nation where the story takes place.<br /><br />The movie has been filmed in the Phoenix area and the buildings that were shown were not anywhere near where they should have been.<br /><br />The first movie based on a Tony Hillerman movie had actually been filmed on the Navajo Nation. Too bad Redford decided to stray from the book.<br /><br />The casting is very dissapointing to see only people who succeed in butchering the beautiful language that we speak.<br /><br />The Navajo Police cars and uniforms are correct, but Joe Leaphorn is a Navajo character that does not know the lanuguage and customs. This is not correct... Leaphorn in all the Hillerman novels knows the customs and traditions.<br /><br />In the Dark Wind, Leaphorn was played by a Non-Indian who was able to speak Navajo. Lou Diamond PHillips did a much better job in attempting to speak Navajo. It appears that Adam Beach who butchered Navajo in Wind Talkers is doing a great job of butchering Navajo again here.<br /><br />it's now 44 minutes into the movie and i'm very dissapointed that i missed Malcom in the Middle.<br /><br />\n",
      "In 1941 Hal Roach had an idea to make short films - he called them \"streamliners\" - between 40 and 50 minutes, to be shown with lenghty main attractions. Quite a few were made, mostly comedies, but also two musicals - the Technicolored \"Fiesta\" with fiery Armida and this film that boasted of Frances Langford, one of the top popular singers of the day. Supporting her were Johnny Downs, who had been singing and dancing in programmers for years and had started out as one of the \"Our Gang\". Harry Langdon supplied the laughs as Hap Holden - it was hard to believe he once rivalled Charlie Chaplin in popularity.<br /><br />The film starts off with an amazing \"drag\" act by the boys of Quinceton College - \"I'm a Chap With a Chip on His Shoulder\". Meanwhile Mar Brynn School for Girls is having enrollment problems - they can't even get boys to go to their proms, the girls are so dowdy!!! The principal's (Esther Dale) niece, Virginia (Frances Langford) has an idea - if they could entice twelve unusual (beautiful) girls to their college, the college would not have to close. Bob (Johnny Downs) decides to try his drag act at Mar Brynn ( I'm not sure why???) He is one of the twelve chosen and the film develops into a \"Some Like It Hot\" storyline, with Bob looking and acting like Jack Lemmon. The girls even sing \"Up At the Crack of Dawn\" on the train.<br /><br />After a few bedtime shenanigans, Frances Langford sings \"Out of the Silence\" in her beautiful melodious voice. When one of the girls gets the measles, the school is quarantined and the musical revue (staged to show off the talents of the 12 girls) must be staged in the greenhouse. Frances sings \"The Farmer's Daughter\" and Bob, out of his disguise now, saves the show and gets the girl.<br /><br />It is not as good as \"Fiesta\" but anything with Frances Langford is worth a look.\n",
      "This 52-minute low-budget college musical can be wincingly second rate, but it has its moments. Bear in mind that the height of its wit is the name of the two colleges: The all-girl Mar Brynn and the all-boy Quinceton. <br /><br />When Mar Brynn president Matilda Collinge becomes worried over declining enrollment, the dean of Mar Brynn, Hap Holden (Harry Langdon), cooks up a scheme to rejuvenate the place. Mar Brynn will offer twelve scholarships in a contest for the loveliest of the lovely, with plenty of publicity. To make sure, there'll be a big notice that the men of Quinceton's Zeta fraternity cannot apply. Huh? Seems the Zetas are famous for their all-male reviews, with the guys dressed to the nines as girls, singing, dancing and fooling around. You can guess what happens. The Zeta's send their president and star lovely, Bob Sheppard (Johnny Downs), to apply for a scholarship as the ravishing Bobbie DeWolfe...and he makes it! For the rest of the movie Downs spends most of his time in drag. He doesn't look bad in a blond wig...a little like Jack Lemmon's Daphne. <br /><br />Wouldn't you know it: Not only does Bob fall for co-ed Virginia Collinge (Frances Langford), Matilda's niece, but there is a big show to put on that will spotlight all the lovelies, including Bob as Bobbie. Yes, there will be mix-ups, confusion, endless drag jokes, songs and smirks. It's all innocent and bland, and some of the movie, in fact, is sort of nostalgic. <br /><br />There's Harry Langdon, for instance, one of the greatest of the silent era comedians. Langdon didn't transfer well to sound. His ego didn't help, either. At 57, he still has that slim body and innocent baby face that, here, doesn't camouflage Hap Holden's more than academic interest in the girls. Langdon still is amusing in his mannerisms. Just as with Buster Keaton, you can look at his face and instantly remember his great years and his sad decline. Frances Langford doesn't bring much to the movie but her voice. For some, that might be enough. She was one of the great singers of the Forties with a creamy sound uniquely hers. She might look like a young co-ed but she doesn't sound like one. In 1946 she and Don Ameche teamed up on radio as John and Blanche Bickerson, a battling couple as stinging as they were funny. Says Blanche, \"You used to be so considerate. Since you got married to me you haven't got any sympathy at all.\" \"I have, too,\" says John, \"I've got everybody's sympathy.\" Says Blanche, \"Believe me, there's better fish in the ocean than the one I caught.\" Says John, \"There's better bait, too.\" She and Ameche are just superb. There's lots of the Bickersons at Amazon, including The Bickersons Volume One. <br /><br />Not so good are the four songs. Three are aggressively, generically, cheerful, although one of them, \"Up at the Crack of Dawn,\" gets a first-rate, swinging treatment from a trio called The Tanner Sisters. The big production number involves lots of skimpy fruit and vegetable costumes. Langford is stuck with the only ballad, a thing sung among the carefully posed co- eds on Mar Brynn's campus lawn. The music's not bad, with a kind of tango-ish quality, but those words... <br /><br />\"Out of the silence come and cling to me / Out of the silence come and bring to me<br /><br />That feeling of contentment when you're near / And that feeling of resentment will disappear <br /><br />When out of the silence comes the sound of your voice / My heart goes leaping; I can't help but rejoice <br /><br />I'm up in heaven from the bottom of the sea / When out of the silence you come to me\" <br /><br />By the end of the movie Bob stops wearing his dress and puts aside his blond wig. He and Virginia embrace.\n",
      "Over the last few months, Turner Classic Movies has featured many Hal Roach films that were in the post Laurel and Hardy era. Around the same time this team left Roach Studios, Roach began specializing in short feature-length films (about an hour in length). Some were pretty good (such as TANKS A MILLION and TOPPER) but many suffered from exceptionally poor scripts and unappealing actors--and the films definitely did not age well. This is one of those forgotten films and after seeing it, I really think TCM should have let it remain forgotten! The film is a cross-dressing comedy with a lot of music. The male students at Quinceton University are angry at being disrespected by the females at Mar Brynn University, so they decide to have one of the guys matriculate as a girl in order to make the girls school look foolish(?). Unlike TOOTSIE, this film had neither a decent script or an actor capable of playing the part. It just wasn't believable nor was it particularly funny. Much of the problem was that the jokes were generally very corny (such as the names of the schools) and the songs pretty poor as well (such as their bizarre tribute to vegetables). In addition, having Kent Rogers along for support didn't help. While Rogers imitations were funny and helped in his brief appearance in STALAG 17 a decade later, here he just seemed like someone's obnoxious child mugging at the camera and doing some terrible impersonations. Aside from a good version of Charlie McCarthy, his Cary Grant and the rest of his attempts were just awful and sounded nothing like the originals. In fact, he should have been embarrassed to see himself on film--it was that bad.<br /><br />Overall, this is a sad and limp comedy that shows none of the genius or spark that once made Roach Studios the gem of Hollywood. Not worth your time, as there are so many better comedies about cross-dressing.\n",
      "As someone who loved The Sixth Sense and Signs, and who liked Unbreakable, I've got to say it's disappointing where Shyamalan seems to be taking his movies.<br /><br />Lady in the Water has none of those attributes. For one thing, it's boring, something none of his other movies were. Here we have a sloppily unstructured mess of a film filled to the brim with incoherent bedtime story \"mythology\" that changes from one minute to the next, so even if you try and follow the world of the story your efforts will only be met with frustration. The film's flaws are many, and as others have and will point them out with much more dexterity than me, I'll simply list the films greatest foibles.<br /><br />1) Shyamalan casts HIMSELF as a John the Baptist character who will inspire \"a great leader who will change everything\" from a hastily constructed presumable political treatise entitled, of all things, The Cookbook. Give me a break! As someone who styles himself as a modern day Hitchcock, M. Night should take a page from that man's book and continue to play cameo roles, not central ones.<br /><br />2) His supporting characters are a mish-mash of ethnic and cultural stereotypes. The \"Asian\" student who attends university but cannot string together a coherent English sentence. Of course the otherworldly \"mythology\" is the remnant of some vaguely Eastern legend based on truth. The old Jewish woman is tackily dressed and her husband is always in the bathroom. Please.<br /><br />3) The film/movie critic is one of the ONLY interesting and rounded characters, and Shyamalan kills him off as he rattles off trite contrivances. This character's appearance seems like a defensive self-conscious way to preempt the critical panning of this film. When a writer forces one of his characters to go on the defensive in dialogue, you know something has got to be wrong with a movie.<br /><br />4) Shyamalan continues his now hackneyed convention of having a protagonist who's suffered tremendous loss in the form of familial death. Enough Already. Paul G is a great actor, the unnecessary back story about a dead family and a lost medical practice trite and out of place.<br /><br />The list goes on and on, but suffice it to say this movie is a waste of celluloid, or hard drive space if you'd prefer. Avoid like plague.\n",
      "It's hard being M. Night Shyamalan. Year after year, his works of uncompromised genius are poorly received by theatergoers and film critics alike. Even Disney didn't want to make his latest film, Lady in the Water, fearing that it was poorly written, featured too large a role for the writer/director, and contained an embarrassingly self-indulgent attack at his detractors, the crrritics. And as much as I hate to agree with Disney, they were absolutely right.<br /><br />The story, as convoluted as you've come to expect from the man, is not the main problem here. Sure, it's chock-full of narfs, tarturic, and poorly drawn stereotypes, but the larger issue for me was the cringe-inducing self-indulgence that runs rampant throughout the film. For instance, Shyamalan plays the role of an author, misunderstood in his time, who will one day influence a boy destined to become the president of the United States. Self-fulfilling prophecies, anyone? His acting is embarrassing and unintentionally hilarious in turns, and his reactions to pivotal plot points had me longing for the brief, campy cameos of years past.<br /><br />While I can understand M. Night's desire to respond to the unenlightened critics that failed to see the staggering brilliance of his previous works, one has to question the response itself. Shyamalan is multitasking here, attempting to transport his audience through the magical realism of his self-proclaimed \"bedtime story\" while simultaneously denouncing his critics for trashing the gospel of M. Night. In the end, we're left with a fairy tale too aware of itself to fully envelop us and a pseudo-manifesto too delusional and self-important to inspire us in any way. In the end, Shyamalan made a film that can really only be enjoyed by himself. It's just a shame that the likes of Paul Giamatti, Bob Balaban, and Freddy Rodriguez have to go down with the Good Ship Shyamalan.\n",
      "he should be put in director jail and the key thrown away for many reasons, not the least of which is how much screen time he gave himself. directors giving themselves bit parts is a fun game, great for trivia and whatnot, but please, don't go The Way of Quentin.<br /><br />i'm of Korean heritage, and the supposed myth upon which this plot is based comes entirely from the memories of a Korean-American woman, and translated by her Americanized daughter with a bad, bad accent. i suppose m. knight thought giving her wild hairstyles would be enough to counter the \"good Asian girl\" stereotype. i wondered where the decision to use the Korean culture came from. maybe he just figured he needed some mysticism, and dipped into whatever culture was handy at the moment. hey, m. knight -- words like \"scrunt\" and \"narf\" don't translate phonetically into English; they'd each have three syllables. being a minority yourself, i thought you'd be more sensitive to details like this.<br /><br />bad stereotypes aside, the premise of a ghostly, Oppie-like Waterworld reject living in the community pool trying to save mankind is retarded. and hey, if she can see the future, what the hell is she crying about? what's weirder than that though, is how readily the building tenants accept all this nonsense, and how much they try to help instead of calling the Loony Police on Giamatti and Howard's characters. having characters that don't question reality alienates the audience, those of us that pay egregious sums of money for good entertainment. that's why Toni Collette's character was awesome in The Sixth Sense: she was freaked out that her son might be insane. so when Paul Giamatti wakes up in his bed and finds what appears to be a pre-pubescent, half-naked teen staring at him, he should freak out and say, \"What the f*** are you doing here and who the f*** are you??!\", not \"Okay, you can stay a while and why aren't I stuttering?\" unbelievable characters, boring and unlikely dialogue, highly questionable mythologies of supposedly Asian origin, and the Standard M. Knight Whirlwind of Act Three Revelations To Wrap Up This Cockamamie Plot, are all reasons why you should not see this movie.<br /><br />so M., please, go directly to Director Jail and turn yourself in. say hello to Antoine Fuqua and Justin Lin for me. maybe if you don't shiv anyone they'll let you do another Amex spot.\n",
      "Hey, I just saw the movie titled in the subject, here is my review.<br /><br />The SIxth Sense marked the debut of M. Night's fame and popularity. The atmosphere and vibe that he created, along with a clever plot and a twist ending made movie-goers everywhere realize the importance of Shyamalan. He, to some extent, created a cult following.<br /><br />Now, four movies later, many of his fans are wondering when he will reveal a movie as amazing as The Sixth Sense. With the OK-at-best movie Unbreakable, people were wondering if he was just a one-hit-wonder director. Then, with Signs, there was some hope that he would make a comeback.<br /><br />But, then he released The Village. After he lost thousands of fans due to that horrendous movie, he attempts at making another good movie. He most certainly fails.<br /><br />The movie places a stuttering man who lost his entire family in an Apartment complex. He, as the super, notices someone swimming late at night. This is the Lady from the title. <br /><br />You see, M. Night created an entire \"Bed Time Story\" about how land people used to coexist with the people of the \"Blue World\" (the ocean). These people speak English. But Land people got greedy and started fighting. But the Blue World people stayed pure, like water, as the Super points out. <br /><br />To help out the greedy people, huge birds that no land person has ever seen flies them to the land, and they must confront a \"Chosen One\" (no really, that is how the put it) and show them the way. The way the chosen one is directed will end up helping the land people as a whole.<br /><br />The Chosen One is, of course, M. Night himself. He can write, direct, produce and now act. He must be the chosen one.<br /><br />Anyways, there are wolves that aren't wolves, but are Scants or something. Their fur is grass and they are green. So that is why no person has seen them. These Scants attack people from the Blue World, but not the land. But there are rules. <br /><br />The night that the Snarf (lady of the blue world, The main Lady) returns to the blue world, the cannot attack them. If they do, these monkeys that aren't monkeys will kill them. There are three. And they are also made out of grass. <br /><br />But normal Scants wont attack Snarfs unless they are Rogue Scants. And those usually wont do it either, unless the Snarf is a Madame Snarf. And she is.<br /><br />So now the protagonist, Cleveland must find people to help him.<br /><br />You see, there are some normal people that help the Snarfs. Among the people are the Healer, the Guardian, the Guild and the Interpreter. These people are the only people who can see the Snarf leave. No one else can... or else it wont work or something.<br /><br />And the moral is that no one knows who they are. I'm serious.<br /><br />Anyways, the main bulk of the movie is Cleveland looking for people who can help, and being wrong a lot. And then he keeps stuttering. And it is annoying.<br /><br />This is definitely M. Night's worst directed movie. Many of the shots are out of focus and hurt your eyes. And then there were the random shots, like when it showed the sign of The Cove while people were dying. And there were a lot of unnecessary close ups.<br /><br />The writing is by far the worst in any movie. The Interpreter figures out what to do by looking at cereal boxes. I am not kidding. It hurt me inside when it happened.<br /><br />The acting was decent by many, but some of the people should not be actors. M. Night was pretty good, but his lines were kept at a minimum.<br /><br />Despite the absurdity of the Bed Time Story, every single person Cleveland told it to believed it immediately. And that is about 15 people. Just imagine someone telling you that a human that looks like everyone else... that doesn't even have gills, lives in the water. Nope, not happening.<br /><br />The only good thing I could find was the music... and only the last song. A few of the other songs were out of place and unnecessary. But the song during the climax was very well composed.<br /><br />M. Night should, in my opinion, stop directing and maybe pick up a different hobby. Like not directing. Or writing.<br /><br />Overview: This movie is in my top 5 worst movies I have ever seen. I laughed at how absurd the story was, but never laughed at the so-called 'funny parts.' Do not see this movie unless you like pain.<br /><br />Final grade: 3/1000\n",
      "I am a huge fan of Signs and The Sixth Sense. I think M. Night Shyamalan did amazing work with the horror genre in both films. He breathed new life into a dying breed of movie, giving them something new among all of the cliché-ridden movies that share the genre.<br /><br />So, I really wanted to like this movie. I, along with pretty much everyone else, was very disappointed by The Village and I very much wanted the director to redeem himself. He failed. Miserabley. Now, I could see his intentions throughout the entire movie. I knew what he was going for and really, it could have worked very well if it had been done correctly. The biggest problem I saw was that he tried to make it be too many different things at once. It was part fairy tale, part horror, part comedy, part fantasy...it goes on. If he had chosen just one and focused his efforts on it, I think the movie would have been very good. Instead, it ended up being a long-winded, pretentious, illogical mess.<br /><br />The movie is self-aware in some ways, often mocking itself and its own ridiculous story and explanations. This works in other movies, like Scream, for example. In this one, though, the subject is so outlandish that even the prodding the movie gives itself can't make it forgivable. You have to buy into a lot of insane stuff before you can even begin to get sucked into the story. In some movies, such a leap of faith is easy to make and the movie is thoroughly entertaining. Not many people question the rationality of Star Wars because the movies make their universe believable. Lady In The Water's universe is so confusing and muddled that it's distracting and the viewer spends more time calling it out than getting involved.<br /><br />There are times when I found myself laughing and I wasn't sure if I was supposed to or not. The scenes play out as completely serious, but it's hard to believe that anyone could have written such scenes and intended them to be taken seriously. It's impossible not to laugh at dialog that includes creatures such as narfs and scrunts.<br /><br />Ultimately, I would call the movie confusing. It doesn't know what it's supposed to be, so the audience is left even more clueless.\n",
      "Wow! I have never been so annoyed by a movie in my life. If it weren't for the fact that I had driven a friend to the theater and had met others there for the sneak preview also, I would have left in the middle of it. And I never leave in the middle of a movie.<br /><br />Within the first half hour, the characters were already getting on my last nerve. The basic premise somewhat interested me, but the stupid characters coupled with an obvious attempt to solicit laughs based on a few ridiculously exaggerated situations and the main character's stutter throughout the movie really clinched it for me. And no, I'm neither a critic nor a fan of Shyamalan. I judge each movie on its own merit and don't give a damn about whose name is on it. I loved Sixth Sense. Unbreakable wasn't exactly my type of movie, but I found it entertaining and wouldn't take issue with it because of the genre. I really didn't care for Signs at all, but I didn't completely detest it. But I really hated this movie. I kept hoping that some bizarre twist would at least give the movie some redeeming quality in my eyes, but almost every turn they took was completely predictable. And the few things that were a bit of a surprise didn't help because they just seemed to me like an obvious attempt at being \"cutesy\".<br /><br />Oh well, I know there will be people out there who like the movie. I did hear a few people laughing at the stupid attempts at humor. Although, by the end of the movie, I was fairly convinced that people just wanted to laugh in order to avoid the awkward situation of silence when laughter is almost expected. It reminded me of when a lousy comedian takes the stage and you get a few people laughing at things that are completely not funny just because it seems to be the thing to do.<br /><br />At any rate, those are my thoughts on the movie. I have never written a review at this site before because nothing has ever moved me to do so like this dud. In fact, I hadn't even registered at the site even though I have visited it regularly for years. I've been kind of curious to read some threads, but was too lazy to take the few minutes to register in order to do so. No more ... the one and only good thing I can see about this movie is that it spurred me into action and now I'm a member here and can take a peek at the discussion threads whenever I want to.\n",
      "What a delightful moment when you fully understand that you do not belong to the masses of mysticism loving, astrology loving, lame brained losers out there. This film proved beyond a doubt that the fairies have left mankind forever. I can see it becoming a great cult film because there are so many people who desperately need to be re woken into life. Of course the real sadness is that his awful film will not grant them that wish either. In fact it is exactly for this reason that it will become a cult film - because it does not deliver on any level. I would suggest that the makers of this film take a long vacation, a long way away from their usual haunts and let time heal their unfortunate souls if that is indeed possible. I feel sorry for the great fairy tales of history and the great writers like George McDonald who must surely be agonizing in his grave. In conclusion I would like to state that the society in which a movie of this nature receives such a large percentage of approval is in some very serious need of mental health medication. A large tablet needs to collectively swallowed by those who find this stuff in the slightest interesting. As I said, perfect fodder for the Democrats who are so removed from reality that they should use this as a campaign opener. Lieberman loses the democrat nomination - need I say more. Poor world if the Democrats regain any form of power in the USA.\n",
      "Being a huge fan of M Night's previous films such as Sixth Sense, Signs and the Village, (unbreakable was god awful), i was very excited for my viewing of this film. I hate saying it, but this movie was really terrible. It was written terribly, the characters were extremely unreal, it was shot very poorly and the acting was terrible. There was no plot progression, and Bryce Dallas Howard plays EXACTLY the same person she did in the village, except being blind she was wet and nymph-y. The screenplay was just pathetic at times (\"This is the scene were the character gets killed off by the monster...etc.) awful. I wish the toilet paper in the restrooms had ads on it for this film, because metaphorically and literally, this movie deserves to be kissing my ass.\n",
      "Wow. Just wow.<br /><br />I don't think I have ever been touched more by a Narf. This movie is perhaps the greatest portrayal of grass ape monkeys in trees that I have ever seen. That alone deserves some respect. The people in charge of the introduction were pretty good too; I am sure many will be touched by their crayola skills. <br /><br />Let the eagle soar, soar as high as she has never soared before. Or so we thought. With a wingspan larger than Jesus on the cross, the Eagle of the Narf is a beautiful creature, zipping through the skies of the Fruity Pebble Interpreter's vision led by the Guild of Seven with the healer of the Narf. Que Pasa? Que bueno. This movie also had the best portrayal of an overbearing Asian mom with a daughter \"who like tell bed time story to you\". Only after drinking milk and pissing your pants, though.\n",
      "I could write a long review about how Lady in the Water was an unfathomably contrived piece of cinematic shite, but I'm sure plenty of that will be going around so I'll just give a list of the three main reasons I never want to see this movie again.<br /><br />1) The role M.Night gave to himself is the most pompous thing I have ever seen in a movie. Yes, people may want to kill him, but it's definitely not because he's written something that will change the world. (it doesn't help that he's not much of an actor, either) 2) Narf? Are you kidding me? People are supposed to hear that without laughing? 3) I watch movies because I want to be entertained or moved or see something intriguing, not because I want to walk away from it dumber than I was before.<br /><br />I hope Shamalayn's ready to soak up ever bad review because by jove, he's earned it.\n",
      "I could NOT WAIT till this movie was released!! Now, I wish I could take back my 3 hours wasted at the sneak preview last night! HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT! I was ready for a suspenseful thriller & received nothing but a huge joke. :-(<br /><br />Want a suspense thriller? Than I suggest you watch the Previews for this movie, since I do believe they used them all in there. The rest of the movie was filled with a JOKE. You could not resist laughing at how stupid it was.<br /><br />I am glad this was a Free Sneak Preview, otherwise I would have demanded a ticket refund for this Falsely Advertised movie.\n",
      "The lighting was bad, the dialog was stiff, unnatural and awkward, the camera work was jumpy and distracting, the sound was in and out, and the acting was terrible.<br /><br />There was nothing redeeming about this movie. Given the cheesy blue screen work (a montage P-Town scenes behind an actor as he marches/struts in place instead of actual film of the actor walking down a street), I should not have expected much, but this disappointed even my limited hope.<br /><br />Low budget films have been done in the past - and done well (Clerks), but this one feels and looks schlocky. After watching it, you feel that your 8 year old niece or nephew could have done better with the family camcorder. What amazes me is that Miramax picked it up and released it.\n",
      "LIE DOWN WITH DOGS was reasonably popular with gay audiences for about fifteen minutes in 1995, but God only knows why. A more abrasive set of overworked stereotypes can scarcely be imagined.<br /><br />Tommy (Wally White) arrives in Provincetown with no money, no job, no place to stay, and grandiose ideas of the good times to be had at a gay-popular summer destination. Needless to say, one misadventure follows another: lecherous would-be employers, pot-smoking landlords, a snaky Latin lover more interested in Tommy's cigarettes than in Tommy himself. But the film is a great deal less interesting than it sounds.<br /><br />In theory, LIE DOWN WITH DOGS satirizes the youthful gay party scene. In practice, however, it plays out in the manner of a particularly charmless Saturday morning cartoon. Written and directed by Wally White himself, the film seems to exist chiefly in order to showcase just how relentlessly unfunny and aggressively obnoxious White can be.<br /><br />Now and then an occasional supporting player, a script idea, or a line of dialogue sparks the film to life--but such moments are too few and too far between to jolt this dog to life. Give it a miss.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer\n",
      "The lowest that I can go on this rating scale is one?<br /><br />Needless to say, December 31, 2006 will go down in history for me. Me, my friends and I were in prep to celebrate what was a successful year - only to be horribly distracted by this heinous excuse for a film.<br /><br />(In fair disclosure, I haven't finished this movie. I am, in fact, writing this review as the movie plays and sends otherwise happy guests running for the door to their \"next party.\")<br /><br />To make a long story short, despite the films creative use of popular dance-club tracks as Danny Tenaglia's Bottom Heavy and Smooth Touch's In My House (oh... and Generate Power... OK, and The Pressure... one more, the Witchdoctor (whilst neon penis' flickered) in the opening credits), I've never seen such a plot less farce. Do not, under any circumstances, watch this movie.<br /><br />If you see a copy for sale, purchase it - send me the movie and a copy of the receipt.

For starters--every gay stereotype is trotted out to go through its motions. Second, there's no plot. Third, ALL the characters are obnoxious. Fourth, I've been to PTown--this was obviously shot off season and it REALLY shows. Fifth, almost no one can act. Sixth, did I mention the main character is really obnoxious? Seven, all the \"comedy\" is lousy. A particularly bad sequence is White picking out dancers from square states (don't ask).<br /><br />The ONLY bright spot here is Randy Becker. He turns in the sole good performance and is VERY hot (to put it mildly)! But he also plays a real jerk.<br /><br />Basically one of the worst gay films ever--maybe THE worst! I wish I could give it a 0--it's not good enough for a 1!\n",
      "I read a lot of bad reviews of this movie and I saw it 2 times in almost 4 years, but it remains not funny. Well, I have to admit, some things are really original, but that doesn't mean it's well performed. The actor's couldn't act and the director is the star is the producer is the screenplay writer! This picture was doomed to fail, because only Welles and Tarantino can do this. If you're planning to direct a movie you've written and payed for, and acted in, fine, go ahead, but don't show it to people outside your family.<br /><br />But I don't want to write too many bad things about this (cult?!) movie. This picture is good because it's bad and that's the reason you should see this film: to watch and learn how you shouldn't make movies. And if you watch it when you're happy, you can see that the clichés were showed for a reason.\n",
      "I purchased this film for the soul purpose of adding to my JESSICA ALBA library. She was in it for a whole 15 seconds. I will never get the other 90 minutes of my life back I spent watching this film. I felt there never was a clear plot to this film. At times the acting seemed a little sluggish also. The film also uses Morgan Fairchild as a star of this film...not! She only appears a couple of times. I feel this is kind of just milking someone in to rent or purchase this film. The ending comes to a close really fast and leaves nothing to the imagination.<br /><br />A pyramid that dispenses pills to make you feel however you want; how clever.\n",
      "What on earth was anyone associated with this project thinking when they made this trash. It has to be the worst film I have ever seen. Their visions of the future are ridiculous and the story line is beyond redemption. The virtual reality date line, despite being a bad idea to start with, is used in the worst possible way in this film. And the first half hour is the most grueling 30 minutes anyone has the displeasure to sit through. Utter rubbish.\n",
      "My wife is a HUGE Rick Springfield fan, so we watched this on Lifetime recently. I love B flicks as much as the next person, and this low budget romantic-thriller is as cheaply made as they come. Despite the Parisian setting, it's apparent that this was not made in France. All of the scenes featuring Paris landmarks are pretty much stock footage, but that's only a minor glitch in this predictable movie. The plot is fairly improbable: A scholar switches places with her fashion model twin and heads to Paris, then gets involved in mystery/romance/blackmail. I've never read a Harlequin novel, but am assuming that this is pretty much the standard formula. Surprisingly, the movie didn't even have any Rick Springfield music! Perhaps his songs were too expensive to use on the soundtrack. Who knows? It's bad stuff but perhaps Rick fans might enjoy.\n",
      "Watch this movie only if you have absolutely nothing else to do and need a laugh. It's a typical harlequin movie,the plot is thin, the story's utterly romantic and ridiculous, and the actors don't have much to do but look beautiful, handsome and glamorous. Andrea Roth is playing twin sisters Kim and Dominique. Dominique is an immensely successful model but has taken to the bottle. Her sister, Kim, is an arts professor and aiming for her Ph.D in the same field. They change places when Kim decides to put Dominique into rehab and take her place as a model for a couple of weeks. There, she meets her dream man, helps Dominique overcome an embarrassing secret and ultimately all ends well. Typical movie...not too bad for people with nothing to do.\n",
      "I'm sure that during his career in his later years Bing Crosby was offered the chance to repeat playing Father O'Malley as an older priest and at one point that would have been a natural fit for him. Unfortunately after this film, Bing was done with the clergy.<br /><br />He tries his best with Father Conroy and his best moments are musical ones especially with Debbie Reynolds, but the story is not convincing. Try as I might, I just can't believe that Robert Wagner turns from opportunistic heel to good guy just to win Debbie Reynolds.<br /><br />In fact the main problem with the movie is Robert Wagner. A good actor he just doesn't have any talent musically. His big number in the movie was You Can't Love Them All was recorded by Dean Martin and had a modest success. Now if Dino had played his part, he might have overcome the script.<br /><br />Bing's best number is The Secret of Christmas. In addition to recording it for the cast album of this film, six years later he recorded it for Frank Sinatra's Reprise label in a joint Christmas album with Old Blue Eyes and Fred Waring's Pennsylvanians. That is the superior version to the one he did in Say One For Me.\n",
      "Nothing else to watch Saturday June 17, 2006; I'll try this one about a spreading virus; they are usually good. That is not a spoiler, after all, the title is \"VIRUS.\"<br /><br />The screenplay was OK as it progressed until the last reel. Then ... and I will not give any spoiler at all; it just became sort of ... 'cartoon-a-rooney!<br /><br />This is the first bad review that I have given. The ending was so obvious and expected, as it rolled to the conclusion; I was telling my dog what was coming next, but I think he already had guessed.<br /><br />I wish LIFETIME would make movies in Hollywood, where the talent is. Oh well.<br /><br />predic\n",
      "The plot of \"Tempo\" sounded really promising, but the end result is quite frankly horrible. The acting on the part of Hugh Dancy is acceptable, as for Cook it is not up to the standard of her other performances. In all their character's relationship seems utterly unbelievable. Watching Melanie Griffith in Tempo though was a sad experience I could have done without. I remember her from films such as \"Working Girl\" were she was witty, funny and sexy. In \"Tempo\" she acts like she is wearing a mask. Her facial expressions are almost non-existent. Another fact that annoyed me with \"Tempo\" was the obvious lack of detail when it came to locations. The story is supposed to take place in Paris, why is it then that throughout the film, street signs are in German?? Even Munich does not look like Munich.\n",
      "\"Sarah James (Melanie Griffith) lives on danger's edge every day as the courier for a ruthless French black market dealer. Her boyfriend, Jack Ganzer (Hugh Dancy), is a handsome, young American expatriate she's seduced into becoming her partner in crime. But, when Jack unexpectedly meets and falls for Jenny Travile (Rachael Leigh Cook), a sexy but seemingly naive jewelry shop clerk, he quickly finds himself trapped in a treacherous love triangle filled with suspicion, vengeance, and murder. This riveting thriller will keep you guessing until the very end,\" according to the DVD sleeve description.<br /><br />\"Tempo\" opens with its exciting car chase climax, then goes into flashbacks leading up to there. Possibly, they had no other way to begin this movie. Next up, you get mild erotica with Ms. Griffith, as the still sexy older woman, wrapping her legs around Mr. Dancy, as the attractive young stud. And, that's about all there is to this downhill film. The chase winds up being the culmination of an unappealing heist storyline. Only Dancy shows skin throughout. Griffith gives her character more vulnerability than the film deserves. And, Ms. Cook is almost completely, and uncharacteristically, nondescript.<br /><br />**** Tempo (6/10/03) Eric Styles ~ Melanie Griffith, Hugh Dancy, Rachel Leigh Cook, Art Malik\n",
      "I used to love Melanie Griffith. She was so sexy and lovable in \"Fear City\", \"Body Double\", and \"Something Wild\", yes even in the rotten \"Cherry 2000\" I still loved her. In Tempo I lost my love, to the knife! Tempo shows the waste of money that is plastic surgery all over Melanie's face. A horrible waste of money and the ruin of a beautiful talent. Disgusting!<br /><br />So is this movie. All that eurotrash money can buy is a deeply flawed script with mediocre performances by many involved. Rachel Lee Cook is as good as she could be given the circumstance of her character. She plays an American student on sabbatical in Paris who, although she does not speak French, is hired by and then immediately given the keys and codes to a jewelry store to satisfy the plot! When the store is robbed the Parisian police open fire on the thieves during a car chase inside the city. Besides the fact that they have not established the car contains thieves or criminals I doubt any modern Western police force would use guns in the situation exposed. The rest on the script is filled with many other unbelievable occurrences, all while expecting the viewer to take it seriously! Looks big budget but never opened theatrically in the US. The DVD release was announced for Summer 2003 but has now been delayed indefinitely, lucky for you! I wonder if Ms. Griffith's surgeons are bidding to keep it off the market? It certainly does not show their work in the best light.<br /><br />As an alternative I would suggest a fun and light film that knows what it is- all fun! \"The Guru\" is now on DVD in case you missed it in the theaters!\n",
      "This film, directed by Eric Styles, has the distinction that it has reversed the emphasis from a woman, to a man, for being the object of sexual desire. Otherwise, it doesn't make much sense. The best redeeming factor is some of the great views of Paris.<br /><br />Sarah, as played by Melanie Griffith, is annoying. That little girl voice in a grown up woman is a turn off. This is a mature woman that has taken up with a much younger, and attractive young man who is seen naked, and or, in different stages of it, in the film. Sarah makes a grave mistake in taking the train back to Paris and holding the precious coin in her hand while she falls asleep! Hellooo! She could have hidden in some other part of her body!<br /><br />Jack, the young man about town, is attracted to the newly arrived American ingenue, Jenny. They immediately fall in love and are seen having sex without any protection. Sorry, but has anyone heard of AIDS? Jenny is made to look terribly provincial with that horrible permanent and her even uglier pigtails.<br /><br />The film doesn't go anywhere, as we figured what was going to be the outcome early on. The direction doesn't help matters at all. Other than a vacation in Paris, what is Malcom McDowell doing in this movie? He only appears in one scene and is seen in another! This film could have been cast with lesser known actors and probably would have been better than what one sees on the screen.<br /><br />Better luck to Mr. Styles next time out.\n",
      "Robert Goddard is a fantastic author, specialising in twisty and turny British historical thrillers. I was psyched when I saw that \"Into the Blue' had been adapted for the small screen, being one of the finest book in a 'trilogy' of sorts. Harry Barnett is highly engaging character, and John Thaw portrays him well, warts and all. The only deterrent to the TV version is that it's far too short. It would have, in this writers opinion, worked better as a mini-series, as the movie leaves out whole scenes from the book and loses the feeling of helplessness that Harry Barnett feels to his plight. On the whole, \"Into the Blue\" is disappointing, not living up to a really good book. Check out the follow-ups, \"Into the Sun\" and \"Never go Back\".\n",
      "When a woman he has just met disappears on the island of Rhodes, Harry's innocence is doubted. But as he begins to examine the woman's past he realizes his closest friend could be involved in murder.<br /><br />Robert Goddard is a solid and reliable British writer of clever and complex mysteries. However this adaptation of his novel Into The Blue as a vehicle for John Thaw is disastrous from word go. Embarrassingly miscast, Thaw struggles with accent and intent as he blunders from one scene to another, and he is horribly betrayed by a great clunking script and ghastly supporting actors - Ba is particularly awful as Harry's reluctant sidekick.<br /><br />Find Goddard's original novel and avoid this turkey at all costs.\n",
      "Hit Me, Steven Shainberg's (Secretary) directorial debut has a lot going for it including a great cast and a truly striking set to utilize. Unfortunately, the story is utterly ridiculous. The first half hour is a long, drawn out affair I guess to establish Elias Koteas' character, who seems to be nothing more than a series of ticks. We find out he has a brother who is mentally retarded, and the state wants to take away, but Elias will not let them happen. On the verge of losing his job at a two star hotel, he becomes involved in an incident (which I won't reveal here) that is so muddled, so badly played out and so unbelievable that I found it hard to believe that the rest of the motivations of the characters in this movie, rested on it. If the source material (a Jim Thompson novel) was unclear,<br /><br />Shainberg certainly didn't make it any clearer which leads to the main character entering into a heist for truly inane reasons. It's hard to get excited about a heist when the reasoning behind it is virtually nonexistent. Yes, there are heists for the sake of heists - and often that works fine - but this film spends a lot of time and energy trying to establish some reason for this to take place, but fails to convince.<br /><br />Good film noir, relies on amoral men, sexual women and desperate desires. Hit Me which claims to be a film noir is simply desperate - for a good story and a stronger execution.\n",
      "This is an utterly putrid film of Jim Thompson's terrific novel, \"A Swell-Looking Babe.\" In adapting the book for the screen, writer Denis Johnson has stripped the novel of all its dark humor and subtext and given us a tepid and dull film. <br /><br />Gone are the father and the whole McCarthyism subplot, which is crucial to what the protagonist does. And Thompson's denouement was dripping with irony. <br /><br />Thompson's protagonist was a multi-layered character who had good reasons for what he did. Here, Elias Koteas is just a boring hotel employee. No offense to the actress who plays the femme fatale, but the role needs someone with a lot more substance than she brings to it.<br /><br />William H. Macy might be highlighted on the DVD box, but he has just one scene. That's it. Come to think of it, he might have been better in the lead role.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor. Instead of renting this piece of crap, read the novel. Your time and money would be better spent.\n",
      "Hit me wastes the film rights to Jim Thompson's excellent novel A SWELL-LOOKING BABE. The story is discarded in favor of a pointless exercise in Scenery-chewing by the usually superb Elias Koteas. We witness pointless double-crosses and mindless plot twists while perverting the novel.\"Hit Me\" is a show of mediocre style instead of things that most people like in movies: good characters, exciting plot, witty dialogue, things like that.<br /><br />Jim Thompson fans, the only people who would want to see this movie anyways, should be prepared for disappointment.\n",
      "Terrible movie. We can definitely tell is the director's debut. The only thing worth was Koteas' performance. Otherwise it seems like a film made by high school kids. It has hints of a black comedy, but in the end it's not. It has a few plot twists but they are completely predictable. I will be taking the DVD to resell it at Blockbuster. I wouldn't want anyone to take a look at my DVD collection and see this thing in there. That would be embarrassing. I have to give it a couple of points because at least at the beginning it tries to give you a background on the reasons why Koteas did what he did, but the way the movie develops is poorly executed.\n",
      "This movie is mostly annoying. <br /><br />Many scenes are unnecessarily prolonged. I started to skip ahead through the last half, and it became slightly more tolerable. <br /><br />The dialog is stream of conscience, and mostly failed to contribute to the story. Maybe if I was thirteen it would be more entertaining. <br /><br />Music plays throughout the entire movie, which comes off as a failed attempt at creativity. I love new filming techniques and what not, but this just didn't work for me. The music makes the entire movie feel like an intro or intermission scene. Maybe it is an attempt to disguise the bad acting.<br /><br />To its credit, this would be a pretty good plot for a porno film.\n",
      "When Will I be Loved is a film that attempts at many things but fails miserably. The title in itself is misleading in that it gives the impression that the main character, Vera, is searching for love that's owed her. In fact, Vera appears to have everything one could possibly wish for in life, including two caring doting parents. Why she chooses to engage in self-destructive and vindicative behavior is a complete mystery. The only reasonable conclusion one could make is that she is bored with with the perfectness of the life into which she is born and wishes to disturb that somehow by becoming attached to a hustler. This movie is pretentious and ridiculous beyond reason. The characters are written in such a way that they are not even recognizable as human, but rather just qualities. Non of the characters are accessible on any level, which makes the viewer completely apathetic to the outcome of their dilemmas. I, for one, was angry that I had wasted my time with a film that was not pleasing on ANY level. In fact, as the previous reviewer mentioned, the music that we are inundated with is distracting and serves no particular purpose. A bitter revolting taste still remains in my mouth from having watched this one hour ago.\n",
      "This movie got a lot of undeserved juice from Roger Ebert's four-star review, and it's just awful. I've liked some of Toback's other work, particularly \"Fingers\", but this thing feels like a really boring home movie on autopilot. It's purportedly about the non-adventures of this bratty little rich girl (Neve Campbell) and her no-account boyfriend (Fred Weller) and, ultimately, their scheme to seduce a rich Italian count (Dominic Chianese) out of some major money. But it takes some time to get to this plot point, and up till then, the movie just meanders in a cinema-verite sort of way that makes it seem like Toback can use it as an excuse for the picture being a dud. It's like he's saying, \"Well, whatever we shot, we shot. I can't be held responsible for the randomness of events.\" <br /><br />The movie goes from Neve Campbell meeting one person on the street to another in what I'm sure Toback would insist was \"character development\", but it's done in such a way that it all rings false. It's scripted without being scripted. In another words, it's contrived. When Neve's college professor (played by Toback) explains what he thinks is going on with Neve and her head games, you can almost hear the gears locking in the background. It might be the most mechanical ad-libbed sequence in history. <br /><br />Toback's use of celebrity here is also peculiar. The Mike Tyson cameo is pretty funny; he actually gives the movie a momentary spark. But when Toback has Neve recognizing a bit actress like Lori Singer on the street like she's Jane Fonda, I wonder what world he's living in. This whole \"expository\" part feels like padding, like Toback didn't have enough legit material to go around. Then, when the action shifts to the \"scheme\" in the final twenty minutes, it's good - it's the best part of the film. But the effect is a little jarring. Toback goes from a lazy, dawdling atmosphere to a sequence that's scripted tighter than Abbott & Costello's Who's on First, and it just doesn't work. The two forms don't really mesh, and you get the feeling Toback only had twenty good minutes in him to begin with - the rest is like a warm-up, like running in place to get the circulation going. And I hate to sound like an old prude (which I'm far from being), but the nude shower scene is an absolute cheap shot; Neve Campbell is just being exploited here. It has nothing to do with her character or anything else; it's completely gratuitous. But I guess anything goes when you have no material. Minus credits, this thing is barely over an hour and fifteen minutes. It hardly seems worth being made.\n",
      "i have never rated a movie before because i have never been so compelled to rate a movie as i have this one. this is without a doubt the worst movie that i have seen since cabin fever. but what makes it worse than cabin fever is that i rented this movie based on roger ebert's review. i will exercise more caution in the future when it comes to ebert's recommendations. the dialog is poorly written and poorly delivered. the editing is clumsy and chaotic. the music score, horrible! music should compliment the story line rather than overpower it. but then again how do you compliment such a bad story? maybe turning up the music even louder and drowning it out was what was needed to make this movie work. i will keep an eye out for future toback movies-so that i can avoid them!\n",
      "I watched this movie to look at Neve Campbell.....possibly the reason the movie makers made it. She is beautiful and a fine actress. A lot of the dialog was interesting,seemed to be a lot of ad libbing. What the heck was Lori Singer doing in the movie? Neve's character meets her in the park and says \"Hi Lori\" and they talk a few minutes about movies. Mike Tyson also makes an appearance as himself and seems to have some acting talent. The film starts and ends with Neve Campbell in a shower. The rest is a waste of eyes and ears. I usually agree with Roger Ebert,but he was one of the very few critics that liked the film. He gave it a top rating. Maybe he loves Neve more than me.\n",
      "When Will I Be Loved is either a really stupid movie or far too clever for its own good. Neve Campbell plays Vera Barrie, a poor little rich girl who, at first glance, appears to be fending off the efforts of everyone around her to use and control her. Her stereotypical wealthy parents make clear how she should arrange every aspect of her life, from what kind of mattress she sleeps on to who she sleeps with. Her boyfriend is a sleazy con artist who hopes to talk her into having sex with a billionaire Italian count for $100,000, wanting in effect, to pimp her. The Count, of course, wants to buy her affection and her body. As it turns out, none of these characters controls this girl. On the contrary, the amoral Vera manipulates almost everyone she comes into contact with for her own amusement and gain. While interviewing for an assistant's job with a college professor, she maneuvers the academic's clumsy efforts to flirt with her into a virtual admission of potential sexual harassment, all but forcing him to offer her the position. This interview takes place as the two are walking along the sidewalks of New York, and when the professor is twice distracted by passers by (one of whom is disgraced boxer Mike Tyson himself in perhaps the high point of the movie) Vera uses each break in their conversation to try to pick up attractive men who happen to be near. She engages in a lesbian tryst behind her boyfriend's back, and she apparently deliberately starts an argument between a couple on a park bench by openly flirting with the boy. In the central plot conflict, the affair with the count, she is the spider weaving every strand of the web. Her boyfriend Ford makes a pathetic attempt to conceal his motives as he introduces the subject, but she seems to expect this kind of low scheme from him and anticipates his every move. Not surprisingly, she quickly accepts and tells him to set it up. The lovestruck Count has only seen Vera briefly twice and compares his ardor for her to the poet Dante's passion for Beatrice. Vera quickly manipulates the Count into upping the ante to one million dollars cash. She gives the Count his afternoon of passion and stashes the money in a safety deposit box immediately thereafter. When Ford returns to claim his share of the loot, she lies, telling him that the Count is a fraud who refused to pay her the $100,000. This leads to a confrontation between Ford and the Italian with deeply tragic consequences for both. Although clearly the cause of this misery, Vera show little evidence of guilt and more than a little self-satisfaction.<br /><br />While this plot may sound interesting, the movie robs it of the energy and intrigue it promises. First of all, Vera is a strangely passive character. She doesn't seem to actively manipulate anyone, she simply reacts to what they do in a way that elicits the behavior she wants. As a result, she is neither interesting nor sympathetic, and, worst of all, her passivity conceals just how despicable she is. When the revelation comes, it is too late and too muted to redeem the story. At best, we go from not liking Vera very much to hating her. We never understand what motivates or satisfies her (beyond her obviously active sex life).<br /><br />Second, much of what happens is simply not very believable. Basically everyone in the story but Vera is a one-note stereotype. The Count is the most problematic. With no back story but the fact that he is a billionaire \"communications\" magnate, we are asked to believe that he would bring six grocery bags full of cash to an apartment to make a woman he'd never met happy in the hope that she might sleep with him -- if she wants to. Perhaps this could happen, but the movie doesn't earn our belief. Our incredulity is sharpened by the fact that Neve Campbell is arguably the least attractive woman in the movie. Neve's highly publicized nude shower scene does little to establish the sexual magnetism Vera is apparently supposed to have. Both naked and clothed, she's somewhat shapeless, which only mirrors the impassive smugness she wears on her pleasant but unremarkable face for most of the movie. Vera doesn't have to look like Angelina Jolie, but she should at least look interested. Finally, the soundtrack is horrible. Most of the dialog is drowned in an incessant music track. Brahms, Bach, and Beethoven accompany Vera almost every moment she's on screen. Perhaps the unending Classical ditties are meant to suggest Vera's sophistication or artistry, but like her vague character they quickly move from puzzling to annoying.\n",
      "I found Toback's earlier film Black and White mildly diverting, so gave this one a whirl. The scuttlebutt was that this was Neve Campbell's best (and sexiest) performance so far. Well, that much may be true-ish, but the rest of this film is, in places, almost unwatchably bad.<br /><br />Most of the characters (or should I say caricatures - take the Italian mogul: did anybody find this man even remotely believable?) are without a shred of originality, and in the case of Ford, bear virtually no resemblance to human beings of the sort you or I might actually meet. It may be that his relentless hustling is *intended* to show him as a pathetic individual - but there is a fine line between depicting characters we may not like but in whom we can invest some interest as to their fate; and, as happens in this film, showing people who are irredeemably ghastly, and about whose fate we don't give a toss.<br /><br />In Black and White, Mike Tyson had a very funny cameo, in which Robert Downey Junior's character tries to seduce him. Here, it looks as if Toback has simply raided his address book and shoehorned as many celebrity cameos as he could into what passes for the plot. Ooh, look, there's Lori Singer! Wow, there's Mike Tyson (again). Ooh, that really is Damon Dash! Toback's own performance as the \"hilariously\" named cross-cultural enabler is pure smugness in a bottle. The only honest moment is when he confesses to wanting to get into Neve Campbell's knickers. We can only speculate as to whether that is a case of art imitating life.<br /><br />And Neve Campbell? Yes, she is good in this. She gets some decent dialogue to get her teeth into and delivers it with aplomb. I still think Wild Things is a better showcase for her talent.<br /><br />The incident towards the end of the film was certainly unexpected; but then again, any idiot can make unexpected things happen in a film. The trick is to work up to it in *some* way. Toback is either incapable of doing this, or simply can't be bothered. The dénouement left me shrugging: so what? Who cares about these cardboard cut-outs?\n",
      "Ugh. Is there really anything else to say about this film? Neve Campbell is completely unconvincing as an object of anyone's desire. She's not talented, nor is she attractive (why hasn't her agent told her to get that overbite fixed???). The sex scenes are crap, the music is distracting, the dialogue is irritating. It seems almost as though there was a longer, better, more interesting film here, but all of the good parts were mysteriously clipped out, leaving behind this disjointed, amateur, faux-artsy heap of rubbish. The pacing in this film is completely off. Why do we need to see 45 minutes of her in that unflattering dress, walking around the city having awkward conversations with random people? Skip this film. Or, if you're really hard up, just skip to the sex scenes. Wait, no, don't, they're awful. Yes, even the lesbian scene. It's really not worth suffering through the rest of this garbage.\n",
      "Okay - I'm a fan of Neve Campbell, which is the primary reason I rented this flick. She shows considerable acting chops here - which is even more impressive when you consider the lack of opportunity for her character to develop.<br /><br />Truth be told, most of the acting was pretty well done. Great soundtrack, pretty views of NYC, wonderful cinematography - this could be a great movie. Neve gets naked during the opening credits? Oh, yeah - settle in and enjoy... enjoy.... um....<br /><br />Shot in 11 days, this film features the writer/director playing a Jewish Professor of Black Studies, Lori Singer playing herself with a rude boyfriend, Mike Tyson playing someone else that just looks like Mike Tyson. Fred Weller plays the sleazy hustler boyfriend (unfaithful, no less) of rich-girl Vera (Neve), Damon Dash plays nice to a guy on the sidewalk who's trying to hustle him, and about half of the cast plays characters with their own names - someone was running low on creativity at this point.<br /><br />Running 81 minutes, about half of the scenes went about twice as long as they should have - which comes out okay, because the other half had nothing to do with story progression or character development. That was okay, too - because the story didn't have anywhere to go to, and after the first 15 minutes, you don't want the characters to develop - you want them to either make sense or go away. (Some make sense - but annoy deeply.) Upshot of the plot - a beautiful young woman of the leisure class bounces between being approached for sex or approaching strangers on the street, asking for phone numbers. A man touted as the most important media mogul of Italy offers a hustler $100,000 for an introduction to his girlfriend - and when she says it's not sufficient, goes out and hits banks to score a million in cash for her. She tells boyfriend that there was no cash, and Bad Things Happen - after which we see that the poor little rich girl is a Bad poor little rich girl.<br /><br />The point? See Neve naked, I guess. Her acting is fine - her taste here, however, is a little shaky.\n",
      "Why the film was even made is the first and lesser of the two puzzles I came away with. The second was that the Chicago Sun Times and Roger Ebert went totally overboard in praising it. I can imagine that some misguided individuals in Hollywood thought the film would \"work\" or at least make a profit, but how some big-time media people be so taken with so awkward an effort really surprises me. I noticed that many professional reviewers rated the film well below 50/100 but the few comments by ordinary viewers were even more telling in terms of negative reaction. This film seems to me a perfect example of how too many of the media pros quite often give far more praise to a film than do ordinary viewers. I always read all the professional reviews and find them cleverly written and well worth the reading, but I very often turn to the comments from the crowd to bring me down to earth.\n",
      "This is one of those truly awful films whose true awfulness doesn't even amuse the viewer. Sometimes a perverse enjoyment can be derived from very bad movies; all that can be derived from this is a keen sense of having wasted a valuable segment of one's alloted time on this earth. The sex scenes are as most risible, boring and lacking in eroticism as one can imagine: there was more eroticism in \"The Donna Reed Show\" - note to those of you not old enough to remember this piece of televisual entertainment, Donna and her unfortunate husband shared a bedroom but not beds. The script, if there was one, is meaningless, wandering twaddle. The plot, such as it is, could have been successfully resolved in fifteen minutes, and the denouement is just plain preposterous. To those of you still determined to watch this because you think it might offer some sexual gratification I can only say again \"THERE IS NO SEX IN THIS MOVIE This film is as entertaining as athlete's foot.\n",
      "for the frustrated guys amongst us: watch the first five minutes and then turn it off, no more boobs from that point on (I know it was a real downer for me too) for all the rest: don't even bother looking at all, jeez. it started with neve under the shower, OK, nice potential, and then nothing. absolutely nothing at all. a few random conversations, poor acting... a bit like watching a porn movie, without all the explicit sex and daring (read skimpy) costumes. after one hour of dribble and complete boredom, there is a twist in the plot! huge surprise for me, because I thought there was no plot up until this point. she gets the cash, dumps the boyfriend and gets away with it. Where the cash came from, how the boyfriend fits into it all, I have no idea, and I couldn't bare to watch it again to figure it out. what a waste of money and ... (talent? Nah, money!)<br /><br />in the words of Krusty the clown: \"I could have pulled a better movie out of my ..Hey, Hey!\"\n",
      "Loved Neve too much to see this movie again, lack of sense, lack of history, lack of imagination...and maybe lack of time. what's Mike Tyson doing in this film? What about the rich parents? who the girlfriend is? what about the African teacher? or better one question what's the sense of the movie? see a looser who sell his girlfriend for one million dollars and manage to get himself in jail. what about the shower scenes does she cleans her conscience there? sis she planned everything or is to unrealistic coincident? the only nice part was hearing the count trying to put some words together about Italian literature.\n",
      "I am a great fan of Neve & what a disappointment. This is total junk filled with lot of nasty & unnecessary stuff. Although the film tries to explain the concept of lonely woman in search of true love the story, dialogs, music & the director has made it unable to watch. The story line is thin, not at all gripping, the dialogs are just filler & the music is just too bad to listen. Some scenes are filled just to kill time & are not worth watching. I was really fed up watching the first half itself not to mention about the second half. I wonder why Neve has acted in this movie. Total waste of time & money. Please avoid even if you accidentally bought it.\n",
      "The only good thing about having rented this film is the opportunity to b**ch about it on IMDb with fellow victims. <br /><br />Where to begin? Maybe with the \"femme fatale\" theme, which seems to be a favorite of cheap, poorly written movies. Neve Campbell plays a heartless young woman who cares only about sex and power. Realistic? Only if you add some depth, history, and complex motivations, none of which exist in this movie. <br /><br />The sex scenes, which I admit I was looking forward to, were nothing but people rubbing against each other or rubbing against couches and moaning for unclear reasons, while Beethoven and Bach blared in the background. (Wow ... this must be an Art Film.)<br /><br />The gratuitous cameos by has-been minor celebrities ... the less-than-simple plot ... the lame attempts at humor ... Neve's charms and the interesting dialogue in one scene with Dominic Chianese are not enough to make up for the general turkeydom of this flick. I can only imagine that Roger Ebert raved about it because he likes Neve and wanted to give her flagging career a boost. Very sad.\n",
      "Forgive me for being extremely blunt, but Neve Campbell is such a lying hypocrite. I saw her complaining on a late night talk show some time about gratuitous nudity in movies today. She said she would never show off her body or appear in such movies, unless it is tastefully done.<br /><br />No, Neve, you're just a snob, and a hypocrite to boot! You're playing a call girl. Yeah, that's a big stretch from Hollywood, really! <br /><br />How is this movie any different from any other soft-core porn made in Hollywood? This movie is gratuitous from beginning to end. Just because it is an independent movie, it does not make this movie any different from a Hollywood, formula-driven spanker flick.<br /><br />I've seen better adult dramas made in the past. \"Unfaithful\" was a better made movie. \"Delta of Venus\" was a better made movie. \"9 1/2 Weeks\" is a better made movie. This movie simply stinks.<br /><br />I'm glad I caught this video for free at the library. If I rented this sludge from a video store, I'd be screaming at the clerk for my money back. Please, avoid this movie like the plague.\n",
      "The summary say it all.<br /><br />This was the 2nd worst movie I have seen to date. #1 being I heart huckabees.<br /><br />This film has no redeeming qualities. The sex scenes are flaccid at best. The score overpowers the crappy dialog but not enough that you do not hear it.<br /><br />The \"character development\" was lame, and went on way too long.<br /><br />Felt caught between wanting to see a naked Nave and the desire to scratch my eyes out.<br /><br />Just like with Huckabees I kept waiting some the film to get better but alas it didn't.<br /><br />I have seen softcore porn with better plots, and at least most of them get you a little turned on by their sex scenes.<br /><br />Not worth the time even if the movie is for free, and someone else buys your popcorn, candy and drink.\n",
      "Never before have I been so annoyed by a movie that I felt the need to bitch about it to the rest of the world; to warn potential viewers that to rent this movie is to agree to a waste of a little over an hour of their life. Quite certainly the WORST movie I have sat through, with the exception of some really bad porn, but that's okay with bad-no-plot porn because its expected. If this movie had contained at least some real sex scenes, I may have excused the stupidity of its entirety, but even the \"sex scenes\" sucked. Pointless: Neve's shower scenes, every character that Neve encounters (i.e. the guys on the street? Mike Tyson? what the hell was that all about?) And as others have pointed out, I too was tormented by the constant piano banging or the incessant score which was always playing louder too loud! Not that we really missed anything like \"dialogue\", since it was so poorly written and acted anyway. Not one character gains any likability or depth. I couldn't have cared less what happened to any of them. I was so taken back by how bad the film was, I had to watch the \"bonus\" interviews on the DVD. In Neve's defense, she appears to have a better grasp of the depth of her character when discussing it in the interview, but unfortunately, Mr. Toback doesn't bring any character development to the audience. Terrible. Just absolutely AWFUL, pointless, and BAD!!\n",
      "That is the question you'll be asking while watching this. This monumental mess will succeed at confusing, boring, and annoying you, not in that order. The director makes you think that hey, I'm making a movie, I know that technique, see how good I am - which tells you how bad it is. In the opening minutes two scenes are spliced together - Campbell and her boyfriend on separate conversations, Campbell while walking down the street. Cinematic parallelism/contrast, anyone? The guy Campbell is walking with is her boss-to-be, who is dismissed without afterthought. What was that scene for? Dunno, who cares? Oh, something about her not wanting a mentor and sex and all that, it all ties together at the end, right? Duh.<br /><br />You can close your eyes and know when they are having sex scenes - by the classical music crescendo the score rams down your throat every time. Which scenes are about as erotic as watching pubic hair grow. In one, you are watching a curtain - yes, folks, a curtain -and something behind it, supposed to evoke prurient fantasies. Instead the viewer is just wondering, why the hell am I watching this curtain? In every sex scene you'll be asking some similar question. <br /><br />There are lots of conversations here, full of the following quotable quotes: <br /><br />Blahblahblahblahblahblah, I got girls, blahblahblahblahblah, where is the Count, blahblahblahblahbblahblahblahblahblahblahblah blahblahblahblah. Blah.<br /><br />There is only one interesting conversation here, between Campbell and the Count as he first attempts to proposition her. Too bad it's buried deep inside a labyrinth of the above-mentioned witty dialogues.<br /><br />Give it a pass, unless you watch it just to have fun trashing it later. Like what I'm doing now. Keeps me from regretting a wasted part of my life.\n",
      "The name of Neve Campbell made me buy this DVD without any further reference, because I try to see her movies since \"Scream\". Unfortunately, \"When Will I Be Loved\" is awful, one of the worse (or maybe the worst) movies of 2004. The story has no development of the characters, taking time to the viewer understand their motives. Mike Tyson, Lori Singer, Professor Hassan Al-Ibrahim Ben Rabinowitz, what are these people doing in the plot? I have not understood the erratic behavior of the amoral lead bisexual character of Vera Barrie in the middle of such mess: she is ambitious, but has a loser as boy-friend; she has a wealthy family that supplies her inclusive with an expensive loft, but prostitutes herself for money. Most of the scenes are too long or even unnecessary. The screenplay seems to be written by a moron or a stupid teenager so imbecile the dialogs and situations are. I love classic music, but the music score is really annoying. How can a producer put money in this crap? Is Neve Campbell losing money in casino or gambling to accept participating and exposing herself in such garbage? My vote is two.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): Fortunately this movie has not been released in Brazil. I saw an American DVD.\n",
      "I agree with most of the other comments. The filming was amateurish, and I'd hope that all the actors in it lied about being in such a joke.<br /><br />I agree that the dialog had a 'Woody Allen' flavor. In fact, his name is mentioned in the movie. I'm wondering if he really directed it, but knew later that it would be such a horrible stinker that he took his name off of it.<br /><br />Neve is a beautiful woman, and they used her beauty to fill the theaters. Her character was also masochistic. Her 'Ratso Rizzo' boyfriend was a sleezebag who did nothing to help the film. In fact, the Count's character was the only redeeming part of it. I thought he was believable as an aging billionaire who usually got what he wanted. Although he could have gotten prettier and more intelligent women for far less than a million bucks.<br /><br />All in all, it stank<br /><br />EverJack<br /><br />I've seen few films that I would call terrible, but this is one of them.<br /><br />EverJack\n",
      "In the commentary it said they filmed this movie in 11 days and it's so bad, it might have been filmed in less. If you have seen the trailer, you've seen everything there is to see about this movie, unless you really want to see the poorly done soft porn scenes. I'm quite serious, the trailer sums up the entire movie without any of the lackluster filler, one is left to drudge through. The move jumps around from one pointless poorly shot scene full of characters one doesn't care about to the next feeling rushed and without focus. Neve is sexy, but I wasn't feeling the \"She's the hottest thing on planet Earth\" vibe they were trying to get across by showing everyone panting after her like dogs in heat, it just came across as fake. The character of Ford is idiotic tired re-tread, which made me want to skip his half of the movie. Also, I really don't think anyone in real life in the \"count's\" position would have done what he did in the last part. If it wanted to show a certain sect of New York as vapid, obnoxious, boring and pointless people without even any real explanation of how they became so, then I guess the film succeeded. I think this is the first movie I've ever regretted watching. The film is not erotic or thrilling.<br /><br />*VAGUE SPOILERS*<br /><br />The only really watchable scene, was the scene of her with the count. The dialogue and acting during this scene stepped up a notch. Her scene with her female lover might have been better if there had been a history and some character development there. This movie was a total disappointment, not even worth watching to fall asleep.\n",
      "This movie is horrible. Avoid it. The storyline sucks, and the only redeeming quality would have been seeing Neve Campbell nude, and even those scenes are UTTERLY disappointing. A pathetic attempt for Neve to revive her career. I guess this was supposed to be \"artsy\", but it missed on that level as well. If Neve was going to do a nude scene, she should have done that in \"Wild Things\", but apparently she refused to do that. Even the sex scenes are about as erotic as watching grass grow. Do yourself a favor, and don't waste the money even for a rental (as I did). This movie is a complete clunker, and was quite frankly boring. The cameos by such \"has-been stars\" as Mike Tyson, and Lori Singer make absolutely no sense and add nothing to the story (if you can call it that) whatsoever! One star out of 10.\n",
      "This movie was terrible. The plot was paper thin. The highlight was the first 2 minutes with Neve showing us all the goods. It was hard to follow what the point was. Were we just supposed to learn not to sell our girlfriend or she will pay back the two male fools that forged this agreement. I felt like it was a waste of 90 minutes of my life. The performances are very weak. Neve never really sells you on her devious side. Weller is so cliché that it makes his role almost cartoonish. They spend almost half this movie trying to explain what a con man he is. They miss the development of any depth of all the other characters. If at all possible don't waste any money or time on this film.\n",
      "James Toback's slight film When will I be Loved has two important things going for it: First, shower scenes that linger longingly over the truly impressive dancer's torso of the Neve Campbell. Secondly, the fact that unlike many of the beautiful bodies that appear in films, this one belongs to an an honest to goodness actor who infuses meaning, mystery and interest into Toback's otherwise shallow and unconvincing story. Her purposefully understated performance in The Company is clearly revealed a choice, as opposed to, say the blank stylings that characterize the work of the great stone face, Keanue Reeves<br /><br />Who should see this film in theaters: Neve Campbell completists.\n",
      "Due to being a fan of the first Scream and having liked James Tobacks Black and White.I was keen on seeing how this film would be with both of them working together,and though it tries to be a smarter Indicent Proposal (a film that is referenced a lot during the movie)is just ends up becoming very boring and painfully slow. The plot:<br /><br />With her family having just brought her a very up-market New York apartment,Vera wants to start a new,by living the high-life.But sadly she is having trouble reaching that level due to her low down \"small hustler\" boyfriend.Though when her boyfriend says the he wants her to spend some time \"entertaining\" a big media mogul,who will pay her what ever she wants (but only when it is just him and her alone),and with this Vera starts to plan away the she can con the media guy and her boyfriend in a very big way.<br /><br />View on the film:<br /><br />For the first twenty minutes writer/director Toback gives the film a bit of a similar feel to Richard Linkletters great first film Slacker.With the characters meeting up in very loose over-lapping scenes.Disappointingly after this,the camera for some dumb reason is kept about half a mile away from anyone in the rest of the film,and whilst this could have worked for a few part of the film to give it an \"intimate\" look.but due to it being constantly used,all the passion and intimacy in the interview in naked scenes is completely lost.And for all of the apartment scenes Toback has a very loud piano playing the same three or four notes,for the whole of the film,which gives the impression that there is a ghost badly playing a piano in the apartment!!. Final view on the film:<br /><br />A enjoyable start,the is ruined by extremely bad directing.\n",
      "Like last year's School for Scoundrels, Woodcock is yet another movie in which Billy Bob Thornton plays a violent dick (no pun intended) and fails to be anywhere near as funny as he should be, thanks to a sloppy, almost laugh-less script. To make matters worse, he's not the only comedian whose considerable talents are wasted on this predictable mess; Ethan Suplee and Seann William Scott, two of the funniest men alive, have nearly nothing to do with their characters. Speaking of predictability, here's a cliché for you: Seen the trailer? Then you've seen the movie. Just about every truly funny part was crammed into the commercials.<br /><br />I love Bad Santa and all, but it has really done more harm than good seeing as another Thornton-acts-like-a-sociopath-and-gets-away-with-it \"comedy\" gets released every year. He is an amazing actor and totally wasted on these forgettable carbon copies. I'm not denying that I laughed a couple of times ('cause let's face it, Thornton abusing kids is funny by default) but in the end Woodcock is just a half-baked comedy-drama which is neither hilarious nor touching.\n",
      "I tried to think of funnier Billy Bob Thornton films than his latest tepid comedy, \"Mr. Woodcock,\" and came up with the following: \"Bad News Bears,\" \"Ice Harvest,\" \"Pushing Tin,\" \"Friday Night Lights,\" \"Bad Santa,\" \"Monster's Ball\" and \"Sling Blade.\" Heck, even \"Goodfellas and \"Passion of the Christ\" had more laughs than this pointless piece of dredge which takes the worst elements of \"Meet the Parents\" and \"The Girl Most Likely To,\" although with none of the charm, intelligence or humor of these pictures.<br /><br />After viewing this movie, however, I have a new-found respect for such comedic works as \"R.V.,\" \"Are We There/Done Yet?,\" \"License To Wed,\" \"Guess Who?,\" \"Soul Plane,\" \"King's Ranson,\" \"My Baby's Daddy,\" \"Little Man\" and any of the \"Scary Movie\" versions.<br /><br />So, I suppose the experience wasn't all terrible ...<br /><br />Ah, but this film was. With two Academy Award-nominated lead actors (Thornton, nominated for \"Sling Blade\" in 1996, and Susan Sarandon, winner in 1995 for \"Dead Man Walking\") joining up with Seann William Scott (\"American Pie,\" \"Old School\") one would think some snickers would result, but few come about.<br /><br />The plot has Williams as John Farley (where's CHRIS Farley when we need him?), a successful self-help author, whose latest book, \"Getting Past Your Past,\" is climbing the bestseller charts. This notoriety allows him to be honored by his small hometown in Nebraska.<br /><br />Going back to receive the Corn County Key honor, his trip home only results in the depressing reality that his mother (Sarandon) will marry his old gym teacher, Mr. Woodcock (Thornton). Woodcock was not only an intense physical education instructor, but a sadist.<br /><br />He humiliates, insults and verbally berates his students, throws balls at them, forces them to run laps and do push-ups as punishment, even those with asthma. But he saves his special vindictiveness for Farley, whom he delights in abusing - mentally and physically. He throws him to the ground repeatedly while teaching wrestling moves; and even forces him to undress and do pull-ups in front of the other students.<br /><br />Now, if something like this REALLY took place, one of the pupils would have surely mentioned it to SOMEONE, and disciplinary action would have been taken against Woodcock. But, evidently, for over 20 years, no one has ever said anything bout this abuse, so the town decides to honor him as educator of the year - to be given at the same time as Farley's.<br /><br />Also, everyone in the berg seems to love the old guy, while Farley's significant other, Tracy (Melissa Sagemiller, \"The Guardian\") admits to having a crush on him.<br /><br />Meanwhile, dredging up all of those bad memories and combining them with the fact that the evil man is having sex with his mother, causes Farley to abandon his nice, passive, positive philosophy and do everything he can to bring Woodcock down. In this endeavor, he utilizes the aid of his extremely stupid friend, Nederman (Ethan Suplee, \"My Name Is Earl\"). In fact, the only likable character is Maggie (Amy Poehler, \"SNL\"), Farley's bitchy agent.<br /><br />He challenges him to a workout contest, as well as a series of carnival midway games and even a corn-eating contest. None of these situations is even remotely funny in any way, shape or form. During its mercifully-short 90-minute run, I laughed just twice - once at the very beginning, and once at the very end.<br /><br />That last guffaw was no doubt brought on by the delirium of the closeness of the closing credits, however. And longtime commercial director Craig Gillespie (in his film debut) doses out the \"comedy\" with large slices of schmaltz, as well as a muddled conclusion, leaving patrons wondering off to movies like \"Death Sentence\" and \"The Brave One\" to satisfy their urge to laugh.\n",
      "Self-help guru who hated his gym teacher goes home to find his mom engaged to said teacher, stilted merriment tries to ensue. The idea is sound the execution isn't. Woodcock, Billy Bob Thorton's gym teacher character is much too one dimensional to really work since he has one expression the whole time. Sean William Scott as the self help guru tries too hard to be wacky and falls on his face. Actually the script just doesn't work since its so obvious where its going. There are laughs and smiles despite of the lack of it all hanging together, and one \"Whoa\" nervous \"oh crap he really got hurt\" laugh towards the end. Worth a look on a slow night on cable where you'll be more forgiving of the dull bits on the way to the good ones.\n",
      "The most unfortunate thing about this movie is the waste of, particularly, an excellent actress like Susan Sarandon but also for wasting Seann William Scott, who has been far better in other comedies (even the American Pie series had more humor and came across as more realistic than Mr. Woodcock) and has also done well in some dramatic/action movies, with comedic qualities in his performance, as in Bulletproof Monk and the Rundown. The only actor in the movie who is enhanced by this entire affair is Amy Poehler, who is far better used here than she ever was in Blade of Glory. She gives an excellent, scene-stealing, scene-chewing performance as Maggie, the press agent and \"handler\" for Scott's inspirational How To book author character, John Farley.<br /><br />Sarandon plays his mom and its an age appropriate role for her and she looks fabulous even as a past middle age adult mother in a small, mid-west town. Her over the top roles in projects like Enchanted, or Children of Dune are better 'paycheck' roles for her than projects such as this or say Speed Racer.<br /><br />The movie is technically proficient from a mainstream studio release point of view. However, it suffers from being a movie that, at least theatrically, barely made its production budget back (approximately $24M, not counting the cost of prints or promotion) -- and you have to wonder how much of that cost went to the director, who clearly did a by the numbers performance (many TV movies, even on basic cable, have more interesting elements in them) and a script that took every simple or easy way out. The script is credited on screen to two writers. It feels and comes across as if they sat around one afternoon thumbing through their old yearbooks, calling a few friends up for some more diverse gym-teacher horror stories, cobbled together the most basic of son/former boyfriend/co-worker/next door neighbor attempts to break couple that seem unsuitable at the start, succeeds, but in the standard-issue feel good ending, they must be brought back together at the last possible moment so the credits can roll on a happy popcorn satiated crowd.<br /><br />It's predictable, its boring, it's not even mildly funny. There is one part where I laughed out loud, towards the end, a physical bit of comedy involving a pot hole and the Thorton character, Woodcock. However, laughing out loud was reflexive to what was otherwise a set up and joke that one could see a mile away. Just like a pie in the face, one laughs, but it's not what one wants to pay $10 for, plus parking, baby-sitter, gas, popcorn, etc.<br /><br />Best to avoid, even on basic cable for free.\n",
      "I saw this because I had nothing else to do... And, really, it seems I should've just stared at the walls for a couple of hours instead of watching this flick.<br /><br />Thornton plays a gym teacher from hell, that is just so mean to his students and almost anyone else, but his teaching techniques are very appreciated in the community... alright, STOP! Anyone that would stay around someone like him for more than 10 seconds would see how much of an a-hole he is. It's just so \"in your face\" that it hurts.<br /><br />William Scott plays some guy that was abused by this teacher and, later on, writes a book about letting go of the past. Yes, he comes back to his home town and realizes he can't let go. I think this is supposed to make fun of all those people that believe this kind of books are of any help to anyone, let alone change one's life. Everyone that says the book changed their lives in the film is a loser.<br /><br />Susan Sarandon is almost invisible in the action of the movie, even though her relationship with Woodcock (now that's a name!) is the trigger for the storm that follows. Note: I mean invisible as in not interesting, mediocre, just plain stupid role.<br /><br />I expected more from the end, but then I just realized: this film looks like it's written by a crazy, emotional cripple gym teacher. Throughout the plot, all of Farley's fans are losers and all those that \"succeeded\" in life are grateful for the humiliation they were subjected to during gym classes. The film ends as John Farley agrees with his teacher's methods and thanks him for the bad way he was treated in school. Although giving up in such a pitiful way has nothing to do with having a backbone, John writes a new book called \"Backbone\". o.0 Conclusion? It's boring, not interesting, not good and certainly annoying. The only funny things about this film are the gags, and those are mediocre as well. So don't go see it in a theater and don't rent it. Just wait until it's shown on TV, as you might find yourself looking for the remote after 15-20 minutes.\n",
      "There are many flaws with this film. It is not gut busting funny, irrespective of what the couple behind me in the cinema thought. It is not even toilet flushing humour. It is simply not funny.<br /><br />It does not contain amazing, thought provoking insights into education, relationships or manipulation of the public and media.<br /><br />All it does contain is 6 basic characters / stereotypes. The nasty PE teacher whose methods affect children, the fat kid who has overcome Mr Woodcock's teaching to become good who has become famous, the widowed lonely mother who has found happiness in the arms of the bully, the nasty bitch who drinks and is abusive to all, the nice girl who stayed in the town and is a teacher herself and the loser, a loser at school and now a loser as an adult.<br /><br />This could have had the makings of a very funny, thought provoking story. By limiting it to a 12A, in the UK, Mr Woodcock is not the devil incarnate, but a \"pussy with a whistle\". If he had made the kids' lives really hell, and this shown on the screen, it could have been both very funny and yet at the same time a poignant reminder of the responsibility of educators to ensure the welfare of their students.<br /><br />The ending prevents any clear message or purpose in the film. If Mr Woodcock is such a horrendous teacher / person with a history of such abuse of power, how is it that the mother does not know? Surely in a small town in Nebraska, the local PE teacher, who is single, would surely attract attention. Kids talk all the time. If this mistreatment was occurring in every lesson, a teacher would have seen something, a pupil would have said something. Why did no parent see any bruising from the impact of the balls on their child's body? At the award ceremony for 'Educator of the year' numerous people stand up to sing the praises of this supposed monster. The fact that he is the best educator, despite his flawed approach suggests that every other teacher in the town is useless or the way to motivate students to achieve is to throw balls at them, or make them do pull ups in their underwear, or to stand on their backs whilst they perform press ups.<br /><br />In writing my report on Mr Woodcock, it would have to say that whilst potential was shown, the end result is a disappointing overall effort. Must do better!\n",
      "i rather enjoyed this movie, but thinking about it afterwards i thought it was a rather disjointed and hollow movie. <br /><br />woodcock is a teacher, whose teaching style borders on child abuse you see him picking on the small kids, the fat kids and other less than athletic kids. <br /><br />which is fine by me, child abuse is a good subject for a serious movie. bullshit author and victim returns home and learns things about him self and makes teacher see the error of his ways sounds like a good serious movie. <br /><br />turn the child abuse into 'tough but fair teaching' and throw in a few gross out larf scenes and it would have made a good revenge comedy. <br /><br />BUT this movie tries to be both a comedy AND a serious movie, and fails in both guises it fails to be a comedy because the subject is way to serious, and it fails to be a serious movie because woodcock is exonerated at the end of the movie.\n",
      "I couldn't even watch the entire movie. It was horrible. It just wasn't funny at all. Sean William Scott is a funny guy, I think this was just the wrong role for him. And Billy Bob is a fantastic actor. I don't know where this one went wrong. The premise is great. This could have been outrageously funny given either a different mix of cast or better directing. But in it's current state, it sucked. Big time. I think Jason Biggs or someone who is more of a \"straight man\" funny-type would have been better in the lead role. But given it's current state, I would advise you to avoid this piece-of-crap. It's just out and out not funny.\n",
      "You could call Mr. Woodcock the latest version of The Billy Bob Thornton Movie. You know, that movie where he plays ornery elder to assorted subordinates, each insult or physical assault a sign of his arrogance and superiority, even as he's waiting to be revealed as a decent guy who only needs to be appreciated. He is, of course, always smarter and faster than all his opponents. Whether you see him as the bully of your own childhood or the payback that bully so richly deserves, you tend not to see the Billy Bob Thornton character as you.<br /><br />In the new version of the BBTM, Thornton plays a gym teacher with a tedious name, introduced as he's pummeling little boys with basketballs, tormenting the ones who are overweight, stutter, or have asthma, infusing all of them with lifelong insecurities and nightmares. Johnny, a cute, freckle-faced boy, described by Woodcock as \"fat and gelatinous,\" grows up to be Seann William Scott. In so doing, he appears to have escaped his fellow victims' pattern. In fact, John has written a best-selling self-help book, Letting Go, all about forgetting the past in order to move on.\n",
      "I enjoy watching the stars of this movie in their other projects so I really wanted to like this movie. I especially liked Billy Bob Thornton in \"School for Scoundrels\" so hoped this was a lot of more of similar humor as 2 \"enemies\" try to one up each other. I believed that due to the previews which play up the humor and conflict between the two characters.<br /><br />Wow, the actual movie is sadly different. The slapstick humor from the previews is noticeably missing and instead there are only a few laughs. Most of those come from Amy Poehler or Ethan Suplee. John Farley (Sean William Scott) just comes across as mean and unlikeable. Jasper Woodcock (Thornton) is dry and unfunny and through various scenes appears to be a person deserving pity almost. Beverly Farley (Susan Sarandon) is similarly sad as her tale unfolds. Rather than the light hearted slapstick comedy I was expecting, I got more of a dark comedy such as War of the Roses. This did not work even as well as that movie, which I also disliked.<br /><br />To have such a great cast, it is just really sad that this was the movie was they made. I am happy that I did not see it in the theater so I did not lose nearly as much money. This is definitely one I recommend people pass by, or better yet, watch the previews and imagine what you think the movie was. I wish I could do that.\n",
      "This so-called comedy is horrendous on all levels, and worst of all--it's boring! It's forgettable! This doesn't even fall into the so-bad-it's good category. About the only positive thing I can say about \"Mr. Woodcock\" is that it's only a little under 80 minutes long. I was looking forward to seeing the flick, since I am a pretty big Billy Bob Thornton fan. Unfortunately, with this movie, he has officially completed the trifecta of duds. First there was \"School for Scoundrels,\" which was mediocre. Then there was \"The Astronaut Farmer,\" which was also mediocre. Now we have \"Mr. Woodcock,\" which is downright awful. There are many actors who I admire and even adore, who have done a fair share of bad movies, but for some reason (before these three movies) I can't think of any less-than-satisfying ones that Billy Bob has done, except for maybe \"Waking Up in Reno.\" It seems like he has reached the I'm-just-here-to-pick-up-my-paycheck phase of his career.<br /><br />The movie has an interesting premise. We all have had crappy gym teachers in the past. Unfortunately, the plot goes nowhere and flings us into one implausible, sitcom-level situation after another. My main problem with the plot is that we're supposed to believe that Mr. Woodcock is a gem to everyone, except Seann William Scott's character. Susan Sarandon's character supposedly finds this man charming, when in all actuality he doesn't show even an ounce of charm throughout the flick. Maybe it would've been funny if he were really mean towards Scott, yet he acts like the nicest guy towards everybody else. We're even supposed to believe that all the townsfolk in this sleepy Midwestern town think he's a great person.<br /><br />My second problem with the plot? Seann William Scott transforms from a calm, mild-mannered motivational speaker to an insane wreck...within a matter of 10 minutes! What kind of character arc is that? First of all, Scott is sadly miscast in his role. Personally, I don't think he possesses much range as an actor. He's Stiffler...that's that! Any role that doesn't require him to be a rude, foul-mouthed weasel takes him out of his element. I was never convinced that Scott was a well-meaning motivational speaker with worldwide acclaim. Amy Poehler, of \"SNL\" infamy, tries to steal the show with her snappy one-liners. Unfortunately, she's just as talentless as the rest of \"SNL's\" current cast, and does nothing to breathe life into this comatose flick.<br /><br />The gags are absolutely predictable and brainless. As if this would surprise anyone, this is another one of those comedies where all the good jokes are given away in the trailer. There's one gag involving a video camera accidentally being left running while Ethan Suplee's character gabs on and on about how hot Scott's mother is. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to discover that there's going to be a later scene, where Susan Sarandon walks in as the video is playing on a TV screen. Not to mention each gag is delivered with all the gusto of a student filmmaker.<br /><br />This movie is such a waste of two brilliant actors. Billy Bob sleeps through his role, keeping the same sneering expression every minute he's on screen. I can't blame him. Like I said before, he probably just did the film to collect a paycheck. Susan Sarandon is forced to play an utterly brainless character, who falls for Woodcock's charm, despite the fact that he has none! I can't recall a worse film she's ever done. I hope her paycheck was pretty huge as well.<br /><br />Plain and simple, this is another lamebrain comedy you should skip. I wouldn't even recommend this on DVD. If you happen to catch it on cable, please change the channel. I can think of a lot of bad comedies that have come out in recent years, but few as merit-less as this one.\n",
      "All throughout high school Mr Woodcock gave kids a really hard time in gym class. So hard that one student wrote a book on how to live your life and overcome such obstacles. This young man is all grown up and returns home to hear that his mother is engaged to...Mr. Woodcock. Thus providing more hard times for our lead character and apparently some unfunny situations that we are suppose to laugh at.<br /><br />Ever since the very funny Bad Santa, there have been a slew of Billy Bob Thorton plays an asshole type comedy. The one prior to this entry was School For Scoundrels. Now, if you play this two movies one after another I guarantee you that you would not be able to tell which character was from which movie, since they are almost the exact same. This film and Scoundrels, both feature Thorton an autopilot. While he still gets the laughs, it's the rest of the film that fails horribly around him, It makes me wonder how many more of these films we are going to get.<br /><br />Sean William Scott gets no laughs here. He is not playing the perverted jerk (Road Trip, American Pie) nor is this an action comedy (The Rundown, Bullet Proof Monk). So we are treated to a boring character, played by a wooden Scott. I can't help but say that the lead role was horrible miscast here.<br /><br />The script is nothing new, nor funny. Mr. Woodcock unfortunately falls into the category that hurt so many comedies. The old, \"If You've Seen The Trailer, You've Seen All The Funny Parts\". It is completely true in this case. I did chuckle here and there, but that's only because Thorton is abusive to little kids.\n",
      "....trailer I have ever seen in my life. Whoever did the advertising for this \"film\" should get some sort of special achievement academy award because it had me totally fooled. The trailer did many things to fool many people, as in show scenes that weren't even amusing in the film and then edit them together in a way that actually gave you quite a laugh to see in the commercial. I usually do not say this but I regret having watched this. This crap that got thrown on the wall and did less then just not stick, it boomeranged.<br /><br />For a bit of a stretch you could say I like others admired some of Billy Bob Thornton's work. Mr. Woodcock didn't exactly push me farther then that feeling of admiration. What it did do though is lose interest in any future projects involving him. As for Susan Sarandon her career like other well respected actors and actresses has turned into a bit of an uneventful one, which is just fine but don't perform in garbage like this. What is quite baffling though is that the director of this film, Craig Gillespie, had simultaneously had another release of his own in Lars and the Real Girl which contrasted in so many ways to Mr. Woodcock. For one, it was at the very least above average. Mr. Woodcock was at the very most, a disaster.<br /><br />Obviously I would not recommend this film. It is not funny and if you are looking for films that contain the same sort of jokes or themes they're plenty of other films Thornton has made before Mr. Woodcock. If you've already seen those then just watch something totally different. It won't make you laugh and it isn't even corny enough to mildly warm your heart. It is a hollow movie that will only make you remember that you at one point watched one the greatest trailers ever.\n",
      "Just saw it. Not the worst movie I've ever seen, but never in my life have I felt such hatred for a movie character. I thought Bad Santa looked like Mother Teresa next to this guy. I wouldn't call it great acting on Thornton's part, (he's totally \"wooden\", no pun intended), he just seems good at being a dick. I literally wanted to bury a claw hammer into this guy's skull, and I'm not a violent person! I kept BEGGING for Stifler to kick his ass. But he was such a puss that I started to hate him, too. Susan Sarandon is still hot, I don't know why she's in this loser. 'Laughed 2 times: when Stifler's buddy got caught on video talking about Sarandon's boobs, and then when that piece of crap Woodcock ate the asphalt. HAHAHA!!! Really hated the end, trying to be all feel good. I wanted to end in Woodcock's death. I know, it's just a movie. The best thing I can say is that it DID get a reaction out of me, I was not apathetic about it.\n",
      "I was actually looking forward to seeing this movie because I have a step father who I often feud with. So naturally I was hopping this would cheer me up and get me to laugh. But boy did this movie depress me and boy did it make me angry.<br /><br />First let me go over what I did like about this film before I trash it. It had what could have been a really good and funny plot. Our lead character discovers that the evil gym teacher that tormented him in middle school is now going to marry his mother. Basically think of that teacher from high school or middle school who hated your guts. You didn't do anything he/she just hated you and made it clear. Now imagine if that teacher going to be your new stepfather/stepmother. What do you do? This sounded hysterical and in the films defenses there were a few funny moments. Sadly however those funny moments were all given away in the trailer. This would be the first problem I had with this film. All the parts that come to mind as being the highlights were already spoiled and what's left is okay but not great.<br /><br />However let's talk about the story a little more. As I said before our star use to be stuck with an evil gym teacher who was out to make his life a living hell. Now he's all grown up and has used his experiences with \"Mr. Woodcock\" to write a self help book. This book becomes a best seller and he now teaches people how to let go of there past. Things are going well until his past come back to hunt him! Now that also could of bin funny. Watching a mans message of letting go of the past get challenge by the bad things that happen to him long ago. Sadly it does not play out well and I will explain later.<br /><br />This Woodcock fellow dose not seem to regret any of the mean things he has done to him. In fact he's very mean to everyone and everything. They made him such a jerk to the point you can't bring your self to like his character. The mom on the other hand seem really nice but one cant help but wonder what is she thinking, is she that desperate? The guy makes very rude and mean spirited comments to her son, even going far to make sex comments about his mother. He treats the people in the town like dirt and everything that comes out of his moth is negativity and insults. Some time his abuse gets physical.<br /><br />So I was starting to think the story was about an evil step father who the son had to save his mother from marrying. After all for some reason he and us the viewer can only see what a bad guy Woodcock really is. But no. By the end of the movie the son must learn to Respect Woodcock and his very abusive ways. So according to the movie women are better off pretending there abusive spouse is a good guy in spite of the fact he treats the world like dirt. For all women can't be happy unless they have a man, even if he is a creep. What kind of message is that to send out! Okay, dose our hero at least manage to persevere his message he has become popular selling? No, by the end he turns back on all of that and decided to take after his mom. Give into stock home syndrome and convinces himself that Woodcock is a good guy. So he finds himself apologizing to an unapologetic abusive jerk. He even declares that all the abuses was good for him. What kind of message are they trying to send out? Well did Woodcock learn any lessons, become sorry for his actions and show off that there is a nice guy in there some ware? As I already said no. They make it very clear he is not sorry for any the things he dose. In the movies Meet the Parents and Meet the Fockers, our lead faced a similar problem with his father in law to be. However that worked out on screen much better. Why? Because by the end the Character who was being a jerk learned his lesson and realizes he was in the wrong. Something that never happens here. The best we get is when Woodcock said \"I'm \"Basically\" sorry\" to the mom but after the entire movie one cant help but feel more mad then amused.<br /><br />To make things a little worse thing are never resolved. Like there a little romance going on between our star and a girl he knew from his old school but it never went any ware. In fact in one moment our \"hero\" cames off as a bit of jerk to because it seems he did not care much for her at all. So now our lead character not that likable earthier. Then when it gets to the end the movie feels as if it just stops. No laterally, it feels like it stop in mid-moment and then the credits start. Leaving the movie feeling unfinished and made to quickly.<br /><br />Over all what could of bin a good movie falls apart because things are never resolved, characters are unlikable, and sends out the message that abuse; verbal or physical is cool as long as your mom love him.<br /><br />That Why Mr. Woodcock gets a 3 out of 10.\n",
      "It's BAD SANTA meets any Will Ferrell sports movie. Which means it's Billy Bob Thornton in a comedy that really sucks. In MR. WOODCOCK, Thornton is psychopathic phys-ed coach, Mr. Woodcock, who persecutes his schoolboy charges like a drill instructor, hurling insults and basketballs at them, stepping on them, making them do laps until they collapse - you know, like your old phys-ed coach from school.<br /><br />My recollection of the name \"Woodcock\" is from BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID (1969) - Paul Newman, trying to convince the Union Pacific Railroad guy to open the train door so the gang won't have to use explosives, flippantly pronouncing the name with that edge of dirtiness, \"Hey, Woodcock! You can't want to get blown up again!\" There is more humor in that one line from BUTCH CASSIDY than there is in all 87 minutes of this quarter-brain comedy.<br /><br />A nerd who is bullied by Mr. Woodcock, grows up to be insufferable Seann William Scott, who leaves his small town and returns as a successful author, having channeled all his angst and repression into self-help books. To his horror, he discovers that his mother is dating Mr. Woodcock. Susan Sarandon plays Scott's airhead boiler mother, sleepwalking through the role while Tim Robbins wasn't looking.<br /><br />Attempted hilarity ensues.<br /><br />This is Craig Gillespie's second directorial effort. It shows. This is writers Michael Carnes' and Josh Gilbert's first writing effort. We can tell. Amy Poehler nearly steals the show. It wasn't that hard to do.<br /><br />I swear if Seann William Scott makes that stupid face again, I'm going to scream. Oh, that's just his face...\n",
      "Amy Poehler is a terrific comedian on Saturday Night Live, but her role in this movie doesn't give her anything to work with. Her character, a publisher's representative guiding a new author on a book tour, is mean, not funny.<br /><br />Susan Sarandon plays the author's mother who is involved with the sadistic gym teacher (Billy Bob Thorton) the author had when he was a chubby junior high student. Unfortunately her role doesn't require a talented actress. The funniest thing is the way she looks in the awful gown she wears as the queen of the corn festival. There is no explanation of why the corn queen is old enough to have a grown son.<br /><br />The plot is the stale one of an author who wrote a best selling self-help book and then adopts behavior that contradicts his advice.<br /><br />Still, it is not the worst movie I've ever seen, and I didn't erase it before watching it.\n",
      "With stars like Billy Bob and Sean William Scott, and with a name like Wookcock, I was expecting some funny moments. However, I was sadly disappointed. This comedy was hardly funny, which spells disaster for any movie. No wonder it did so poorly at the box office.<br /><br />Billy Bob delivers a good performance as the balls buster tough PE coach whom we discover has redeeming values in the end. He's played this sarcastic, slightly mean guy in several films. Unfortunately, he was about all this movie had going for it. A corn eating contest is just not funny. And a guy under the bed while his mom gets it on is just gross.<br /><br />FINAL VERDICT: The laughs are few and far between, skip this.\n",
      "Mr.Woodcock is a boring comedy which did not produce me any laughs because all the jokes are clichéd and tired.That's a serious problem in a comedy.Billy Bob Thornton is criminally wasted in this movie.He's an extraordinary actor but this movie does not show all his talent.He should appear in more movies like A Simple Plan or Bad Santa,which really take advantage of his talent,and not in craps like School for Scoundrels or Mr.Woodcock.Director Craig Gillespie shows nothing of artistic zeal.His work is simply mercenary.It was very difficult to me laughing with this movie because,as I said,all the jokes are tired and they left to be funny 20 years ago.I do not recommend this movie.\n",
      "Generally I think I like feature-film spin-offs of TV sitcoms more than most viewers. But this is a dire example of the genre.<br /><br />I suspect the actors were forced into performing in it for contractual reasons beyond their control. As revenge they then conspired to make a comedy that contained no laughs. If this was the case they were successful.\n",
      "The story is idealess.<br /><br />The costumes are laughable.<br /><br />The set and scenery are boring.<br /><br />The fights are simple.<br /><br />The main actress is good looking, the main actor is not. But both are acting bad, together with all the other actors as well.<br /><br />The music is annoying.<br /><br />The camera-work and editing are static. Special effects are rare and unconvincing.<br /><br />There is no climax and the end is unspectacular.<br /><br />All in all, there is nothing that makes this worth your time. Only for people who really wants to know about every movie of this genre.\n",
      "Boy oh boy. When you see a film as laughable as this one, you know there must be a hell. Yes, we're back in dodgy Italian barbarian film territory, where well-oiled beefcakes duel with rubber swords against helmet-clad stuntmen who die without being touched. Obtrusive music lurks behind every corner, as our badly dubbed hero must rescue the princess from a fate worse than.. watching this movie again? He must follow the ancient prophesy of marrying her and sitting on the legendary Throne Of Fire before the day is out, otherwise.. THE WORLD IS DOOMED!! DOOMED, I tell ya!! Unfortunately, he proves to be rather inept at his job.. getting captured no less than three times and wasting the spell his dad gives him that makes his body invisible and invulnerable to everything (except fire, conveniently). Some 'hero'. The princess, on the other hand is far more impressive.. she can butt-kick for fun and finishes the film without a scratch on her, despite the fact she is only dressed in a bra and loincloth 95% of the picture. Meanwhile, an eclipse that looks suspiciously like a raisin held up against a light bulb tells our protagonist he is nearly out of time, so he must hurry.. it won't be easy, with all those boom mikes to dodge. Can he make it? Who cares, quite frankly. I'm more interested in the mindset of those who would waste their life watching this kind of nonsense in the first place. (Don't worry about me, I've already gone mad..) And if all that still hasn't put you off, get this.. Our muscular, tough-as-nails lead character's real, non-acting first name is.. PETER. I shall now close this review, because if you're anything like me, you'll spend the next 5 minutes in hysterics. In fact, I can feel them come on again.. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA etc. 2/10\n",
      "This cheapjack Conan rip-off is so mightily inept that the villain actually comes off appearing more sympathetic, interesting and intelligent, not to mention handsomer, than the hero. Surely this was an unintended consequence of the poor script and bad acting, the seemingly lumbering stupidity of the wooden muscle-bound hero and the obligatory trotting around cardboard sets in g-strings by these supposedly heroic do-gooders. This makes the Conan and Beastmaster films look like Ben-Hur and El Cid in comparison. The only (accidental)redeeming feature is the striking presence of Harrison Muller, Jr. as Morak a surprisingly appealing \"bad guy.\" Both his person and his character stand out, perhaps largely due to the colossally boring nature of those around him. It's hardly his fault that he was warped by destiny as the plot would have it...the viewer can't help but root for him to succeed since he's the only one of any interest or appeal on scene.\n",
      "The plot outline for this film promised so much, a group of French/Italian (its difficult to tell) female prisoners break out of their prison, and set out on the run, killing a few police officers and kidnapping a bus load of young tennis players, this seems a perfect setting for an \"erotic thriller\", but as is to be expected from a very low budget European film from the late seventies, the film fails to live up to any of this potential. This film is a laughable, poorly dubbed, appallingly edited story which tries to be intelligent, managing to achieve the seemingly impossible combination of pretentiousness and stupidity. The film has few redeeming features, but the main one is that it is quite a good laugh to watch with a few mates when drunk, especially at the hilarious musical score and the cheap and nasty production values, (at one point it actually switches from widescreen to normal, then back to widescreen a few minutes later). If you wanted you could probably kid yourself into thinking this was an art-house film since its foreign and attempts to deal with \"issues\" in societies, which it does rather clumsily, otherwise just watch it and laugh.\n",
      "This is really bad. Awful dubbing, rubbish acting, badly shot, choppily edited and generally terrible.<br /><br />I also didn't like the fact that the scummy rapist judge didn't get shot at the end and was allowed to completely get away with forcing himself on another woman! that was a sickening scene and its a fairly misogynistic film.<br /><br />However, there are 3 plus points. All of them are the foxy women. Erica (Ada Pometti) is particularly sexy and has a great but brief sex scene. Patrizia Funari has a nice backside which is shown off. And the girl who isn't listed here but plays 'Susanna' is very gorgeous.<br /><br />I shall be checking out more of their films!<br /><br />However, they were the ONLY three plus points and thats why the film gets 3 from me. 1 POINT for each sexy woman!\n",
      "The worst Columbo ever was \"No time to die.\" This was the second worst. Why? Because Columbo was completely out of character, and committed reprehensible and illegal acts in trapping his prey: he plainly assaulted the suspect (death threats and ramming his car), held him against his will, extorted evidence (the location of the gun), a confession, and under threat of death a an ongoing covenant to take the fall.<br /><br />Columbo is supposed to be a sympathetic goody-goody character (albeit a slob), not a felon.\n",
      "They went to the bottom of the alphabet to get two bottom-of-the-barrel performances. But Yaeger is merely ineffectual. Wendt is spectacularly bad. And the pity is that the interest the viewer could have in the episode lies entirely in how well he pulls off his murder scheme. His character is supposed to be the smart and responsible brother but he cannot get past the boorishness of Normie to give us anything. As a result, this is the worst Columbo movie I have ever seen.\n",
      "In a decay neighborhood, the asthmatic and allergic amateurish photographer Marvin Montrose (Karl Geary) spends his days and nights confined in his room snooping his neighbors in the next building with his camera. When a boy disappears in the spot and then the local drug dealer Desmond (Keith Robinson), Marvin suspects of a mysterious garbage man (Lance Henriksen) and his sister Rosy (Alexis Dziena) and her friend Carmen (Rebecca Mader) investigate him. Meanwhile, Marvin witnesses the death of Detective Gary Dumars (John Kapelos) and a stranger on the street by two mutant Judas Breed insects and discloses that their prime suspect is the CDC Agent Kirchner.<br /><br />\"Mimic: Sentinel\" is a shameful and boring rip-off of \"The Rear Window\" for approximately forty minutes, with a guy confined in his room and snooping his neighbors. The character of Agent Kirchner is not well developed and the gore action is too brief, with the death of most of the characters in a few minutes. In the end, watching this forgettable movie is a pure waste of time and money. My vote is four.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): \"Mutação 3: O Sentinela\" (\"Mutation 3: The Sentinel\")\n",
      "Man, this movie sucked sh!t through a straw. First, one has to overcome about more than an hour of nonsensical voyeurism, than - out of the blue - some unrecognizable roaches show up from out of the blue and than, klabbam!, there the pitiful apocalypse: the monsters die and the good guy, his sister and his - to be - lover are miraculously saved and all is well again.<br /><br />I wonder what the producers were thinking. The first two Mimics I liked a lot. For the disgusting effects and the, more or less, tension throughout the pictures, but this third was a bunch of crap. It was actually rather sad, on the filmer's account, to focus on the breasts of Rosy to create some kind of, whatever, image: an American teenage girl, smoking dope once in a while, looking good and showing off her bra. Well, one good thing; she didn't die.<br /><br />This movie made no sense. Whatsoever. I'm sorry I watched it.<br /><br />Dikke Jules (Fat Jules)\n",
      "I can understand why they chose a different style for this installment of Mimic. Too bad I can't understand anything else, such as:<br /><br />Why the honored characters (the bugs) have barely but a cameo appearance, and hardly contribute to the storyline other than they are the \"mystery killers\"? Well duh.<br /><br />Why the only relationship between the main character (the brother) and the bugs, is that he was one of the surviving children of the plague that the bugs were created for in the first place? Like if it were not for this fact, viewers wouldn't be able to link this installment with the first two.<br /><br />How is the sister's involvement with her drug dealer associate important to the story other than just about everyone in the neighborhood is purported to be a drug user?<br /><br />How is it important that the police officer investigating the killings become romantically involved with the mother? And not waste any time either...<br /><br />Why is the relationship between the brother and the across-the-road beautiful neighbor not carried forward? For that matter, was it important to the storyline in the first place?<br /><br />Sigh. I was left overly disappointed after watching this. I mean Mimic 2 was bad enough, but sheeze, this is so far worse it's not even worth watching to say you've seen it.\n",
      "I won't labour the details since I think most of the points I would make have already been made by others. The acting is pedestrian at best. The plot is as thin as clingfilm and is a rather poor homage to Hitchcock's Rear Window (Please note: regarded as something of a masterpiece by many).<br /><br />Rear window works because we see everything from the main character's (Jimmy Stewart) perspective, namely the wheelchair, in his bedroom. Everything the audience sees is from that vantage point. Jimmy Stewart's character is a helpless observer who plays no part in any activity outside his bedroom. This creates an atmosphere of claustrophobia and racks up the tension continuously. This reaches an unbearable point when he sees the murderer returning home to his apartment, which his girlfriend has just broken into, looking for evidence. This tension is created by the knowledge that Stewart is powerless to warn or help her.<br /><br />The same scene is recreated in Mimic: Sentinel but is completely flat and offers us absolutely no tension whatsoever. There are various other nods to Rear Window which immediately tells us that the writers didn't really have anything new or novel to say in this film. There are various plot elements that seem to do little other than fill in time (in a film which seems overly long at 78 minutes). For example when he attempts to report the danger to the police, his mother starts an intimate affair with the officer whom she had met briefly once before several years ago? Then there is the kooky, doped up sister, who walks around flapping her arms all the time. The main character is too active to be the impotent character Stewart plays but he's also too feeble to be a real hero character.<br /><br />Leaving the Rear Window connection, there's very little rhyme or reason to the rest of the plot. No explanation is provided for many plot elements and very little motivation is given to any of the characters. It's all just an excuse for some atmospheric shots of not very scary giant insects dragging people off into the dark and some occasional shots of blood splatter. No attempt if made to create a feeling of impending dread as any real person would have in such a situation. None of the characters are in any way sympathetic and it's hard to get worked up enough to care about the film when we don't care about any of the characters.<br /><br />We're left with a film which lacks the substance of Rear Window and which fails to provide any substance of it's own. I wouldn't bother spending money to rent it but if it's on TV and you're a completist who liked the other two Mimic films, then go ahead.\n",
      "Mimic: Sentinel is set in New York where a sufferer of the disease Stricklers which is mentioned in the first Mimic (1997) named Marvin (Karl Geary) lives with his mom Simone (Amada Plummer) & younger sister Rosy (Alexis Dziena) in an apartment block, he can rarely venture outside his sterile room as he is apparently 'environmentally sensitive' whatever that means. So what does he do to pass the time? For the past 10 years he has taken pictures of the people in the opposite apartment block & basically spies on them, we all have to have a hobby I suppose. However his picture taking gets him into trouble when he witnesses a drug dealer name Des (Keith Robinson) get killed by someone. Marvin begins to organise an investigation into the killing & drags his sister into it but they soon find out that what killed Des wasn't human, it was in fact one of the giant mutant cockroaches from the previous films & it's up to him to stop them...<br /><br />Written & directed by J.T. Petty Mimic: Sentinel is the third film in the Mimic series & you know a series is in trouble when they stop numbering them after only the first two & as if by magic my fears are confirmed with this distinctly average at best horror/thriller. The script is basically Hitchcock's Rear Window (1954) with killer genetically created giant bugs, if that sounds appealing to you then what are you reading this for? Go & rent it. If it doesn't sound appealing then you, like me, may not be that impressed with Mimic: Sentinel. The thing is I don't know if I missed something because the final 20 odd minutes came out of nowhere & I actually didn't really understand what was going on. For instance Lance Henriksen suddenly turns up & I honestly don't know who he was or his significance other than his photo is on the back of one of Marvin's books & he seems to know about the killer bugs. He also has this bag of stuff which I presume is the killer bugs blood so they won't attack him but I'm only guessing because that's what happened in the first film. There are other bits & pieces that I didn't understand either like the 'dead' body Rosy shows Marvin under the drain cover at the start yet even though he takes photos of it it never mentioned or seen again, maybe I did miss something I don't know. Maybe Mimic: Sentinel doesn't have any plot holes or loose ends & it's a deeply complex intricately written & thought out piece of suspenseful film-making that I was too stupid to 'get', or then again maybe it's a cheap straight-to-video poorly written & contrived horror sequel that totally rips-off Rear Window & is basically rubbish, who knows...<br /><br />Director Petty does OK, the film has that downbeat somewhat gray look & feel about it like the previous two with it's rundown apartment blocks. Am I the only one who found the constant scenes shot through the lens of Marvin's camera highly annoying, I can't be surely? Also was I the only on who thought this film was far too dark to the extent where it actually became almost impossible to see what was going on at times? The special effect's are used sparingly & are OK but nothing that's going to impress you that much, the giant bugs don't feature that much which doesn't help. The gore is minimal, there's some blood splatter & someone is impaled on the giant bugs pincers (or whatever they are) but not much else to get excited about.<br /><br />Technically Mimic: Sentinel is alright & has that Hollywood polish about it, it's well made enough for sure with decent production values. The acting isn't that good & the always great Henriksen has nothing more than a glorified cameo.<br /><br />Mimic: Sentinel is an OK watch, I didn't think it was anything special & not as good as the previous two but that's just my opinion for what it's worth. Worth a watch if your desperate but don't bust a gut to see it.\n",
      "Sequels, by their nature, are supposed to be inferior to the original because they no longer have originality at their side. My my, does MIMIC 3 prove this notion. The film tries to be a thoughtful approach to the series, but it only ends up being tedious, dull, and wholly lacking in entertainment value. Too bad, because the actors do some good work, but the movie, sporting a thankfully short running time, does itself no favors. Dull characters mixed in with a dull story equals a dull movie. Even THE SIMPSONS gave us a better REAR WINDOW retread. And is it me, or did our voyeur photographer always seem to run out of film or forgot to click on his camera whenever the mimics were in view? Well, I guess if he actually took a picture of them the whole movie would be over, and the dumb cop couldn't keep thinking that our hero was nuts. How contrived.<br /><br />3 out of 10\n",
      "I liked the previous two installments of the series so I gave it a try and rented this stinker.<br /><br />First of all, the story had no suspense or action whatsoever. Only the last 10 (or 5) minutes show a little action when the main character (a peeping Tom who only lives to take photos of other people) kills some bugs with an explosion in his kitchen while he hides in the fridge.<br /><br />The film moves along at snails pace and although it only runs for about 70 minutes or so it feels like 3 hours.<br /><br />The story also makes little sense and offers no or very little explanation. If you don't know Mimic 1 or 2 you won't have any clue whats going on, where the bugs come from, why they are so big, why they mimic humans and so on. There is NO explanation at all.<br /><br />All in all, a waste of time and money. When the end credits rolled I was thinking \"WTF, it can't end like this?\". Very lame.<br /><br />And what was a great actor like L. Hendriksen doing in such a movie? Did he really need the money?<br /><br />Guys, avoid this movie. Rent Pitch Black or Aliens instead if you want to see a good monster movie. No wonder this stinker went straight to video. 1/10.\n",
      "MIMIC 3 (spoilers) is one of the worst movies ever made. The main character (Geary) is someone who supposedly has severe allergies and lives in a sealed off room. However, when it suits the movie, the same guy is walking around in the alleys of the Bronx. Geary plays his character like an early 1950s Jerry Lewis with all the nervous ticks and funny walks that he must have thought come with allergies. Watching Geary constantly twitching and having spastic attacks makes the movie more enjoyable than it should be. Geary spends most of his time in his room taking photos of his neighbors at the apartment house across the street. Apparently none of his neighbors have heard of vertical blinds or window shades, and so they are all walking around naked, arguing, fighting, painting, etc. for the amusement of Geary who is taking photos of these folks (even at night, and without a flash). Even the Cockroach Monster has an apartment, though the issue is never addressed as to how he pays the rent, what bank opened a checking account for Mr. Roach, and how he signed the lease. At some point people start disappearing from the apartments, and Geary starts to see Mr. Roach killing some of them from his window. That is about as exciting as this movie gets. Amanda Plummer plays the mother of Jerry Lewis-Geary, and there is not much of a point to her role in the film. Lance Henrikson was in this movie for about five minutes of some really bad acting. Apparently he needed the money. The ending of this film is pathetic. It has been done in dozens of other movies, Jerry Lewis Geary gets into the refrigerator while the oxygen tanks in his house blow up all the roaches. Geary's girlfriend, who he left outside the refrigerator is not injured either, and his sister, who was sliced and diced by the Roaches (there is more than one BIG ROACH) miraculously pulls through. MIMIC 3 is so bad that the fact that any of the human characters survived just added to how bad this movie was.\n",
      "Enjoyed this film and the great acting by Karl Geary (Marvin), who did a great job of acting like a person who had Strickland Disease and had me completing feeling sorry for him. Marvin's big hobby was being a simple PEEPING TOM, who enjoyed watching all his neighbor's, old, young and in between. I think his favorite window to look into was Carmen, (Rebecca Nader), who seemed to get hot and bothered over Marvin and his great hobby of posting pictures all over the wall and especially hers! Marvin's sister Rosy, (Alexis Dziena) was the person who introduced Marvin to Carmen and this of course started a wonderful relationship. There is plenty of mystery concerning the horrible habits of a Judas Bug that gets so hungry he tries to break into the trunk of a car. This film is entertaining and does not need to be put under a microscope and studied, if you don't like the beginning, Turn it Off !\n",
      "Oh man ! I know boring and idiot things exist but I'm all time surprised to see new things like that.<br /><br />First this movie is not one. It's like a TV series. Second story is so amateur. Like we ask to student to make something about anything.<br /><br />Man! I give 1/10 for this movie cause it's so bad. Even if actor/actress are not so bad, that technical is not so bad too I can't give more. A movie or TV series is first a story. And when this story is more bore than bore it's not possible to enjoy watching it.<br /><br />I really don't know how it's possible to have money to \"create\" thing like that. And people who give money for so bad things like spend their money. Better buy some lottery ticket.<br /><br />Hope they will not have Mimic 4! Man!\n",
      "I really loved the first movie Mimic. The second movie, Mimic 2: Hardshell was ok too. It had some very suspenseful moments, and it felt true to the original film.<br /><br />This third film, written and directed by a young filmmaker, J.T. Petty, who as the documentary on the dvd indicated was just given the premise of \"Rear Window with Roaches\" and was told to run with it. He did, but he ran as far away from the original concept as he could. This movie plodded along at a snail's pace with uninteresting characters and no real story sense and basically had no suspense at all until the last ten minutes. And it was painful to wade through the movie to get to that part, but I just had to see how this turkey was going to end. I can understand the filmmaker and studio wanting to try something new and different, but this whole story premise was too off the wall and didn't give the viewer what he expected after having already seen the previous two films. This movie was shot in Romania (I can't understand why-----didn't we have any locations available in America?)and didn't have a very good look to it at all.<br /><br />I can only hope that if there is a fourth movie, it will be made by more experienced and competent filmmakers and will give the viewers what they expect in a franchise horror film. I believe this movie was a straight-to-video release because the studio had no faith in this movie to<br /><br />stand up at the box office. And they were right.\n",
      "As a lifelong Agatha Christie fan, and devotee of Joan Hickson's late 80s/early 90s Miss Marple adaptations, I had hoped that these early 80s curios would help fill my need for more Agatha. I can't imagine that these stagey productions would have met with the great lady's approval. Slow moving (especially when Tommy and Tuppence are on screen), and so lacking in dramatic tension that I am surprised more than a couple of episodes were ever screened.<br /><br />Francesca Annis is dreadfully OTT and arch. Her stage make-up makes her look like a doll or a clown in some sequences. James Warwick is very wooden and emotionless. Reece Dinsdale's comedy cockney is even more annoying.<br /><br />Tommy and Tuppence are totally unlikeable, and their laboured attempts at flirtation and humour fail at every attempt. Every witticism and remark in the script clunks to the floor under the deadly delivery of Annis and Warwick.<br /><br />There's a nice range of guest appearances from some actors who went on to great things (Anita Dobson as a maid who bites the dust after two minutes on screen), but the supporting roles are obviously less significant to the two leads. As a result, anyone who tries to bring a bit of life to things (Liz Smith and Joan Sanderson, for example) are shot down as soon as they appear on the same set as Tommy and Tuppence.<br /><br />The studio sets and studio lighting have aged very badly, and the whole production feels dated.\n",
      "OK. so i liked some of the films that Star Cinema has produced.... and i thought, why not go see this movie Milan. The crux of the matter is... this is a bad movie. The lead character(Piolo Pascual)is so confused about his existence that his existentialist angst comes as an ABBA song (you know... can you hear the drums, Fernando?) Not only that! This movie offers a picturesque glimpse of italy (oh my god! is that why the movie was entitled Milan?) but that's it. Expect no more. What you'll get from the beginning of the film until the end is pure drivel! A guy loses his wife... he searches her out in Milan... (for the life of me i don't get this, how can you just jump the boat and just sink, sink, sink, happily sink?) and then he finds the loving arms of another Filipina who (surprise!)falls in love with him too and then just when things cannot go on any murkier, he finds his wife who is (another surprise!) a rape victim(!) and is too ashamed to go home so she rejects him and they all live miserably all together! The same goes for the audience. <br /><br />I just want to puke after seeing this film.<br /><br />Bad! Teribly bad!\n",
      "I'm not going to do a very deep review for this. I'll be honest, I saw this movie in a $3.99 bin at a grocery store and read the synopsis, and I had to buy it to see if it was as ridiculous as it sounded. Basically, Freedom Deep is the story of Liam, who, under the guidance of his mentor \"Kurt Cobain\" (yes, THE Kurt Cobain. The heroine addict lead singer of Nirvana who killed himself), begins to create a new religion based on his teachings. The story follows Liam simultaneously through the year 1998 as a 10 year old kid and in the year 2018 as a friggin idiot. As a kid Liam is shown beat up and neglected. He and has a revelation one night as he hallucinates the image of \"Kurt Cobain\" (!) at a hippy party. From that moment on Liam knows his purpose in life, though I'm kind of glad he didn't really share it with the audience. In 2018, the world has gone through an apocalypse and Liam is ready to journey to the last remains of civilization to spread the word of Kurt Cobain. And through facing difficult obstacles he does just that! Go Liam! The music is trippy, the acting is great considering there's no dialog, and the film processing attempted to have a fresh hip look, but ended up being annoying. I didn't even get the laugh I was hoping for.\n",
      "...I'd rate this fourth out of the four I can think of. As Australian post-apocalyptic movies featuring Kurt Cobain's ghost go, Freedom Deep is A-number-one!<br /><br />So I watch bad movies for fun. That's my excuse. After reading the back of the DVD's packaging, which contains the phrase \"we see how his talents are nutured (sic) and developed under the guidance of his spiritual mentor - 'Kurt Cobain,'\" how could I not buy it? I could not not, that's how. There's another misspelling in the quote above I'd love to reproduce, but IMDb automatically corrects it every time I try.<br /><br />Freedom Deep takes place mostly in two time periods, between which it alternates: 1998-ish and 2018, with a little bit of \"much later\" as well. The nineties bit concerns a young boy named Liam, who has trouble at home and trouble with the other children at school. And, come to think of it, trouble with his teacher at school, a fact which is revealed in an inadvertently hilarious scene. The other prominent timeline focuses on an adult Liam (who, it should be noted, looks absolutely nothing like young Liam) who basically wanders around the desert a lot. To spice things up, sometimes he wanders through the snow. At one point, in a radical narrative departure, he manages to wander in a boat.<br /><br />Not sold on it yet? Just wait. The best part is that no incarnation of our protagonist, not young Liam, adult Liam or even old Liam, speaks a single word. Not because they're mute, but because it's, y'know, artsy. There's some voice-over here and there, but even that's sparse. I believe it was 28 minutes into the movie before *any* main character actually spoke a word to someone else, and that was through a headset to an unknown party. It's all about as enthralling as it sounds.<br /><br />Freedom Deep is a mess. It's Gordian's Knot, and I have no idea why anybody tied it. So there's this woman. She's a bounty hunter. Or an assassin. Or a government agent or something. I guess it's possible she's from the future of the future. I couldn't tell you. It's 2018, civilization's presumably in crumbles, and for completely unknown reasons she's been tasked with finding Liam wandering out in the desert. Liam's probably wandering the desert to get away from the society that wronged him, except I think that society has been destroyed for close to 20 years at this point. Maybe whatever society sprung up in its place picked on him too. Liam's had it rough. Anyway, she shoots a camel, finds her quarry, has a confusing wireless conversation, burns her headset, rapes Liam at knifepoint (!), they fall in love, and he never says a word. Your typical boy meets girl, really.<br /><br />All the while, she reads through the pages of a book Liam has written. It's the same book Liam started writing back in the 1998 timeline. One would hope that's a helluva book. And clearly it is, as she decides to spare his life because of it; she's convinced it must reach civilization.<br /><br />Meanwhile, young Liam runs away from home and manages to find a surrogate family in the form of a gay couple, half of which is a transsexual \"mother\" and the other half of which really likes heroin. Liam escapes his troubles, as he always has, through his love of plaid shirts, a horrendous hair-do, Kurt Cobain, and lots of music that sounds nothing like Kurt Cobain's. Music rights cost money. Soon he finds another outlet for his pain (pain best represented in voice-over by the heartfelt words \"heal my wounds\"). Poetry!<br /><br />The movie states that young Liam's story starts in 1998; we're told no more. Liam endures school and home life, escapes from it, finds an odd replacement family, takes up writing, gets in a series of publications, and becomes well-known enough to get into a meeting with corporate bigwigs who'd like to put his column in their magazine as a regular feature, all by March 12th of 1998, the movie tells us. Even assuming the rest of it started on January 1st, that little dude can move.<br /><br />I have no idea what to make of this movie. I didn't mention how Kurt Cobain really fits in because, well, he doesn't. Why does anyone care what a pubescent mute thinks, at least enough to publish him? Who is sending someone to catch and possibly kill adult Liam? Why? Who does our almost-assassin talk to on her headset? Why does she burn the thing afterwards? Are there wireless towers or satellites after the nuclear holocaust? What the heck happened with the cliff scene? Why does the word \"prophet\" keep popping up in reference to this movie? If Liam arrives at what looks like a fully intact city at the end, was it really harmed in the first place? Is he just some nutjob wandering around the desert for years and all the rest is his hallucination? Why did the writer-director think he could get away with three versions of a main character who never utters a word? I'm baffled.<br /><br />It's not the worst movie I've seen (I've given out a whole lot of one-star ratings), but it's bad. And it might not be the most confusing movie I've seen, but it's at least top five. As bad movie fare goes, it's entertaining and maybe worth a watch, but isn't a must-see crappy flick experience.<br /><br />In conclusion, let me present a condensed version of what the experience of watching this movie was like:<br /><br />Me: Wait, what?<br /><br />Roommate: I dunno.<br /><br />Me: Rewind it.<br /><br />(Rewind.) (Watch it again.)<br /><br />Together: What?<br /><br />(Repeat.)\n",
      "This is probably the worst movie I have ever seen. I actually watched it all the way through to see if it could get any worse than it was at the beginning. It did! It appears to be 2 separate movies spliced together. The only thing interesting about it was the fact that some, if not all of it, was filmed around Melbourne, Australia, where my son attended Veterinary School. If it weren't for the opportunity to pick out recognizable landmarks, this movie would have been unbearable to watch. It was extremely painful to view anyway. It is difficult to tell if the people who put this movie together were serious in their intentions or were just trying for an oddball campy look. In any event it came out badly.\n",
      "Take \"Six-String Samurai,\" suck every last bit of humor and talent out of it, set it in Australia and it STILL wouldn't be as awful as this unwatchable mess of self-obsessed celluloid.<br /><br />Not so much a movie as it is a horrendously long, mind-bendingly pretentious music video - \"Freedom Deep\" may very well qualify for Legendary Bad Movie status. At the very least it has to be one of the most toxically self-indulgent train wrecks since \"Lisztomania\" - which is an achievement of sorts, I suppose.<br /><br />The film's story, such as it is, concerns the efforts of Liam to bring the holy word of Kurt Cobain (!) to a suffering, nuke-ravaged humanity. Interspersed with this epic quest are flash backs to Liam's youth when he was a pudgy, abused kid who looks abso-tootly-ootly nothing like his older self.<br /><br />If the plot of this film sounds even mildly interesting - it's not. It's tedious and trite by turns and the film's only saving grace is that there's no dialog. Indeed, I can't even begin to imagine how teeth-grindingly awful this mis-begotten mess would be if we had to listen to these characters speak.\n",
      "Just like last years GAB, this sucked. WWE's offer of three excellent PPV's in a row (Judgment Day, One Night Stand and Vengeance) made this writer wonder if they had been made to seen sense, but how wrong I was.<br /><br />Animal and Heidenreich (possible the worst team ever and an insult to Hawk) beat the best team in WWE right now, Joey Mercury and Johnny Nitro to win the WWE tag team titles in a rubbish match.<br /><br />Booker T beat Christian in a fair contest, however there was no build up to the match and it seemed that the match was only booked to pad the PPV out.<br /><br />The Mexicools (Super Crazy, Psicosis and Juventud) won the BWO (Stevie Richards, Simon Dean and The Blue Meanie) in a worthless match.<br /><br />Orlando Jordan beat, yes BEAT Chris Benoit in a slump.

      "Witchcraft 10 ended with LAPD Detective Lutz returning home from England, with the papers necessary to join Interpol's Bureau 17 if she wished. In this one, there's no mention of that, so it seems she chose not to do so. She's reunited with her partner Garner, who had stayed home during her trip, as well as her short skirts and high heels.<br /><br />Will Spanner is back, with his fiancé Kelly Jordan. I'm supposing this is his girlfriend Keli of parts 5, 6, 7, and 9. However, she doesn't seem to remember having met Lutz and Garner before, or having learned of Will's witchcraft skills, which Keli had. Will and Kelly go to visit her atheist sister Colleen at the Catholic college where she is studying drama.<br /><br />Colleen is rehearsing for a role as one of the three witches in Shakespeare's Macbeth \"Double, double toil and trouble; Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.\" In fact, writer/director Ron Ford said his original title for this was Witchcraft XI: The Weird Sisters. Their professor is not pleased with how they perform it, and he and the most assertive of the three women, Keri Burston, feel they should go to a ceremony and perform a real witchcraft ceremony to lend their performance credibility. There, they will try to revive three sisters who'd been executed for witchcraft who had tried to conjure Abaddon and open a gate to hell.<br /><br />The ceremony gives them all an opportunity (one of many) to take their tops off. Naturally, they're spied upon by three horny college guys, and when one of them dies, Detective Lutz and Garner show up to investigate. Meanwhile, the redheaded would-be Shakespearean Maria Fitzwater becomes possessed by one of the witch sisters.<br /><br />Things get worse, and Will and Kelly try to save Colleen, while Lutz and Garner continue to investigate. There's a lot of nudity in this one, from Kelly, the three lovely young college students (I was surprised this appears to be the only film any of the three have been in), and Lutz. There's considerably more blood and gore than most entries in the series, including a face chomping, and someone being torn limb from limb.<br /><br />Certainly not a great movie by any measure, but fairly entertaining, and I've found them to grow on me a bit the more titles in the series I see. Acting in this one isn't as bad as in some of the other later titles. There's a curious cameo by early film star Anita Page as a nun who knows something about the three witches; IMDb's page for her has a number of photos of her from the '20s and '30s. The sound is definitely better, with the dialogue being pretty clear at all times, whereas in some others it was poorly recorded or drowned by the soundtrack.\n",
      "I am one of an increasing aficionados of this series. Having abandoned quality after the first one the series has opted for repeating a formula with usually increasing flesh and hoping that word of mouth and shear deluge of films will make money. The trick has largely worked. I found out about this via an occult and a vampire website where the stage and screen actor Stephen Armourae listed them as minor films with a particular interest, some of the actresses have appeared in sketches by him as well. In this lot thats bare flesh and bad acting. Steve is clearly unimpressed that the word Witchcraft should be attached to this lot: he is an occultism and has written on wicca. OK so here's the deal: Will Spanner returns, continuously since Witchcraft 2, with the delightful if too peroxide Delia Sheppard, here with his fiancé Kelly Jordan who for the sake of the script has not met people she appeared with in previous films. That's not a good sign for a film. The thrust of this one is that Kelly's sister and 3 attractive students can't act better than mahogany and they will murder Macbeth. So they are encouraged to perform a supposed witchcraft ritual to give authenticity to their performances. Gate of Hell inevitably opens and everyone gets their clothes off. This is not rated highly compared to the others in the series by Armourae either. But the sound is better and Anita Page is a bonus: a silent star aged 90 giving this a poignancy it doesn't deserve.\n",
      "This movie is definitely soft-core porn. That's its downfall. Had this been a straight horror flick it would have been much better. Cinemax, HBO, and Showtime should pay attention to this. Notice:Soft-core horror flicks are bad. Worse than horror flicks. Worse than soft-core porn movies. If this movie is so bad, you may ask, how did I end up looking at it? Well, a friend popped it in, then left the room. You may think, to subject someone to this horrible movie, he's not that good a friend. The jury's still out on that verdict. The sexual interludes actually made this film worse. I was actually checking my watch during the sexual interludes. If this happens to you during a soft-core porn flick that's a very, very bad sign. In fact if this movie had just resorted to removing the sexual interludes I no doubt would have scored it higher than a 1. But I bet you're wondering, how do the sex scenes in a soft-core porn flick make it worse. If anything that's supposed to make it better, right? For Witchcraft XI, WRONG! If you haven't seen this flick yet and want to (though if you do, I feel very sorry for you, my friend), you may want to skip the next sentence and read on, cause I think I may be dropping a spoiler. This is why the sex scenes made this movie worse: In one scene one of the witches resurrects one of her sisters, then they proceed to get naked and have sex. I actually had to stop and say, \"What the F***!\" And I don't care if it is a soft-core horror flick, Spirits holding you down, pulling your shirt up, and raping you is never a good idea in a movie. Almost as bad as the tree-rape scene in whatever movie it was. I did have to admit that Officer Lutz deserved it more than anyone else, a payback so to speak for her being such a Queen C*nt throughout the movie. And with those hoish clothes she wore, more suited to a streetwalker than a police officer, I kind of had the feeling something sick like that would happen. I mean, when the first scene of a movie is a sex scene, you know two things. 1. That it's a soft-core porn flick. 2. That it's gonna be one good movie. Well, I was right about the first thing, but horribly, horribly wrong about the second. If you value a critic's opinion (and most people don't), then listen to what I have to say. I've seen plenty of horror flicks and plenty of soft-core porn flicks as well. If you're a fan of either (I happen to be a fan of both), avoid Witchcraft XI (and the other Witchcraft movies if they're any bit as bad as this embarrassment) like it's a person with the flu and you haven't had your flu shots. It's that bad. If you see this movie, I promise you will regret it.\n",
      "I can't write much about this game, except that it has the worst movement controls I have ever experienced in any game. Ever. And I've got several hundred boxes on my shelves here.<br /><br />I was excited about playing another sneaker, after the Thief series was lacking the third part for a long time, so I thought I give splinter cell a try. The training mission was good and interesting, and quickly brought me into the \"I want to play this\" mood. The movement controls/logic, however, were so extremely bad I didn't play the game further than the second map - it is the second game ever I threw away. Really.<br /><br />If you plan to spend money on this game, make sure you can test play it a bit before, so you can decide for yourself whether you get along with the movement controls.\n",
      "Watching a movie about four guys visiting microbreweries and drinking and like being the designated driver on a pubcrawl. After ten minutes, you're dying for a beer, yourself. There's simply no point to it and you get nothing out of it. The four beer travellers/drinkers do nothing to movie this movie along. If anything, they slowed it down. You can easily leave half this movie on the cutting room floor and nobody would know the difference. It seems like a student film, or a home movie that was never edited. If you want to learn something about beer, there are plenty of books on Amazon.com to read. If you want to be entertained, your spit out of luck.\n",
      "I think I only watched and suffered through this dud so I could come here and warn everyone. Do NOT watch this film unless it's under pain of death!! <br /><br />Richard Losee is the star, director and producer of this. If this was someone like Clint Eastwood, it would be a commendable achievement but not in this case as Losee lives up to his name and is inept and incompetent in each role. As an actor, he's stiff and wooden, the action scenes are bad enough but the love scenes are cringe worthy in their total lack of passion, cold as a fish comes to mind. As a director, he lacks the ability to make any scene interesting or exciting and flubs every chance to do so, couldn't direct traffic. But he fails worst as producer as that makes him overall responsible for putting this mess together in the first place!<br /><br />The plot, what there is, concerns the kidnapping of a small child who turns out to be Losee's son (in real life as well), when he's hired to be the ransom driver for the child's family. Taking it's cue from Dirty Harry but doing it badly, Losee has to drive in his souped up car from ransom drop to the next to get instructions. <br /><br />Cue lots of fast cars driving around for no discernible reason and a ludicrous 'drag race' with a bunch of rednecks who are even lower on the evolutionary scale than the rest of the cast. It all comes to an end much slower than you are wishing it will, if only the film had moved as fast as the hero's car. Perhaps if you thought that the 'Dukes of Hazzard' is about the best that it gets, you might enjoy this film, but I doubt it.....<br /><br />Give this bomb a sidetrack and put up the detour sign.\n",
      "This movie is not really anything like the title implies it is about. When I think rebel, I think bikers with leather jackets, or people who laugh in the face of the law. Here it is three losers looking for a break all for varying reasons. Well not all that varying as they all want money. One, is an unemployed actor who has a lovely wife and is apparently a bad actor. One, is a writer who is shopping around a book that is bad. The other guy is just trying to escape his mother's shadow or something...was not quite as sure about him. Well, a man who runs a rather crappy establishment has assembled these men to perform a robbery of an armored car. So that is about all there is to it. They take a train to Chicago, rob the armored car and get on the train and head on back home. Except, once on the train things begin to unravel as greed takes over one of the guys, another gets jumpy and then dead bodies begin to turn up. It is rather interesting to watch in places as it does move fairly quickly and the lead guy is likable enough as is his wife who stands by him. You also get to see the chief from Get Smart as the mastermind behind the heist. However, you also get to see a chase scene at the end that is to long and rather anti-climatic and the other guys in the heist are rather bad in how they are presented.\n",
      "In the same tradition of \"The Beatniks\" comes this little gem, from our friends on the Satellite of Love. And if you are thinking you know what a beatnik looks like, then think again. About the only thing this movie has in common with a \"beatnik\" is the club at the beginning of the movie. Beatniks are really nothing more than the backdrop and comedy relief. It's like they're part of set. <br /><br />The movie itself resolves around the schemings of \"Mr.T\". If you are thinking of a tough and athletic black man with many gold chains and rings when you hear that, then is the wrong movie for you. Instead this \"Mr.T\" is a bald white male, accessorized with a \"sitting cane\", removable goatee and cigarette holder. He is a Beatnik because he plays chess there as his front. The rest of his crew is a bunch of drunks, losers and squares. Perhaps it is the director's subtle message that radical and subversive behavior exhibits itself in the mind of regular looking and average drones. I should stop thinking so much as this is a bad movie. Trying to analyze it any more, just makes my gums hurt more.<br /><br />If you haven't figured it out already, this is a heist picture with a twist. If you have seen any of the Ocean 11 movies (Frank,Dino,Sammy,Brad,Matt and George versions are all prime and easy examples of the type of story this is attempting) or any of numerous heist related movies (too many to name),there are good and better ones than this one. <br /><br />Do yourself a favor and stay away from this movie if it is not accompanied by two robot friends and a guy in a red jump suit. They are the only reason to watch this movie at all. I also recommend some Bulleit Bourbon with it, 5 shots-worth. Spread it out evenly, as the slow parts will require medicine. It is a homage to a true beatnik, \"Moonie\" : \"I KILLED THAT FAT BARKEEP!!!\"\n",
      "Pretty to look at, _Behind the Sun_ is nonetheless typical of the painfully conservative international films Miramax increasingly chooses to bring to U.S. audiences. Its symbolism is obvious and heavy-handed, its dialogue melodramatic, and its performances insultingly broad. It conforms perfectly to the feel-good foreign fluff that has flooded the market at least since _Cinema Paradisio_; that is, it embodies to a \"t\" the safe, lowest-common-denominator American conception of what a foreign film \"should\" be. As a result of Miramax's market dominance, more dynamic international films that seek to surprise us or advance film language in some way get marginalized, going largely unseen in the U.S.\n",
      "Although the plot doesn't indend to do anything else, it could not move me at all. The story, in its essence, is about unbearable poverty and despair. But it's not told this way. Besides the bloodfeud and the poverty, it makes the impression of a rather picturesque life.<br /><br />Instead of focusing on the characters tragedys, instead of trying to make one feel the protagonist's hopeless situation, of making the lives' barreness tangible through corresponding photography, the film luxuriates in pompous, satiated and abundant pictures.<br /><br />Thus the movie never makes one really understand many things, e.g., why the protagonist isn't just going away, as he does anyway in the end, why the heads of the families insist on continuing the feud, why the fire eater girl returns, why she returns on her own, in the middle of the night, by foot, why she leaves ahd so on.<br /><br />Behind the sun hardly touches the surface, and tries to sell actually heavy stuff as pretty romantic drama in soft and colorful pictures -<br /><br />WHICH MAKES ME PUKE\n",
      "I've seen a lot of foreign movies and enjoyed them. I rarely comment on any film whatsoever, but this one came so highly praised and so poorly performing that I had to comment on it and warn others. What the &*^$ where the people at Cannes thinking when this was given the Jury Award? I have no idea...<br /><br />Get ready to watch a very slow account of two traveling teachers as they accompany other travels on their way across the Iraq/Iran border. I could not stop watching the movie because I was waiting for something to happen. It didn't. The teachers constantly try to teach people how to read and write, but everyone ignores them. I mean, seriously ignores them. Every time one of them asks a question they have to repeat it about 5 times The others travelers are permanently depressed and silent. Its hard to have any sympathy for them: there is extremely little known about the characters, no development, they show no willingness to accomplish anything except trek across the next mountain and hide from unseen helicopters and soldiers.<br /><br />The one positive comment I could make is that the landscape backdrops are quite amazing and the people are realistically gritty.<br /><br />By far the biggest disappointment.\n",
      "okay, now i know that this won an award at cannes but i can only presume that this is because the judges were working under the principle that seems to afflict literary critics from time to time. if it is incomprehensible then it cant be really bad, and who knows it might be great.<br /><br />in a handout which i picked up in the cinema the director confesses to the fact that after each days shooting she then went and wrote the screenplay for the next days filming! now i am no movie mainstream boy, i like to be challenged by films and i like films that require effort. however, i do like films that appear to have something to say, not necessarily a simple beginning, middle, end storyline but at least something in terms of character development if not plot development.<br /><br />it just makes me wonder what the reaction to this film would have been if it had been made in Britain or the USA or France? would everyone be saying its breathtaking and moving and a truly political film? or would we have been saying to the director 'next time work out what you want to say or how you are going to say it...or even better both'. last comment must go to my faithful fellow cinema goers who laughed when the titles came up and someone was credited with writing the script. the smile on my face was not so much through laughter as a wince of uncomprehending pain.\n",
      "Blackboards is at its best when considered a dreamy, surreal take on real-world issues. It's a shame though that the film's style doesn't match it's content  if it had then it could have been truly affecting and memorable. As it is, it pairs the visual and conceptual silliness of men running around with blackboards strapped to them, and the visual and conceptual non-silliness of innocents meeting trouble on the hills of the Iran/Iraq border, which confuses the message. Further, shooting the otherwise farcical adventures of the blackboaders in the (ever popular) faux-documentary realism style undermines Samira Makhmalmaf's attempt to consider issues such as imprisonment, gender equality, education and communication, which are all jumbled around in the text fairly loosely, and not in the regimented way the style would have enhanced.<br /><br />Not only are these issues trampled on by the blackboarders, but the characters are not exactly equipped with the faculties to make them engaging for 85 minutes. They are moronic, moribund individuals, trapped on empty endless hillsides or engulfed in smoke which might as well be a metaphor for their foresight. They are not interesting. The trouble is it's unclear whether the director is mocking them or pitying them. One assumes the former, but unfortunately the message is, like the writing on the boards, incomplete.\n",
      "terrible....boring,and these people acted like morons.....i turned it off after getting tired of listening to these guys repeat every question a million times. they just say the same crap over and over.....and the marriage scene made me sick. annoying little bastards.<br /><br />I'm sure the movie was powerful in its own right,and i really wanted to see the hardships these guys went through, but i just couldn't get over how they talked to each other....the constant nagging gave me a headache,they were reminding me of 4 year olds bugging mom at the toy store.<br /><br />i would have like to have seen what happened after the marriage,but i couldn't get through it.....im sure this movie was great n all,but personally i like my films to not put me to sleep.....just didn't really need to be a flick,as far as im concermed. im sure you al think im shallow,but think what you will,i have a healthy respect for film,and im not the Hollywood lover you might assume i am. film doesn't need to be boring to make a statement.\n",
      "I had expected to be impressed by the landscapes, charmed by the story, engaged by the politics. But no. The plot, dialogue and characterisation were as featureless as the scenery. The filming was unimaginative. I was bored by every minute of this film.\n",
      "LAW and ORDER, SVU. Olivia and Elliot are loudmouthed, over emotional, driven by emotion and ego, and should never have been allowed to be on the force. To laugh at Olivia and say that she is kind of \"passionate\" is saying that police persons are supposed to do their job based on circumstantial evidence, emotion, and ego. I can't believe the amount of lame lies that most of the detectives come up with on this show. The amount of abuse of power, lying and accusing innocent people who happen to know the actual criminal, using any trick or lie imaginable to trick someone into confessing. The fact remains that even the police psychiatrists call most police reports \"the most elaborative works of fiction there are\" and the amount of people who are convicted based on those reports is unconscionable. There used to be a saying about \"innocent until proved guilty\" that is supposed to be their attitude. Instead they should say \"convicted unless proved innocent\" because that seems to be the attitude of the police. The fact that they are trying to \"make a case\" out of nothing is the reason that DNA evidence has proved thousands of people innocent that have already been tried and convicted in the press and therefor in the court. After all, the idea that somehow convicting innocent people makes up for the ones who are guilty and weren't arrested is ignorant, but that seems to be the attitude of the police shows like this and in the minds of the average public, since shows like this teach them to be ignorant of the law. Innocence hasn't become more guarded since we have already found the court system to be consistently wrong by a steady percentage. For instance, how many people believe that O.J. Simpson murdered his wife years ago? He proved to the nation that in the United States one gets as much justice as they pay afford. Poor people or I should say anyone who can't afford large legal fees are going to jail unless a technicality happens. People, especially the police, complain that the criminals are released on technicalities. If the police did their jobs and didn't convict whoever was available at the time for trumped up charges, then, they wouldn't need technicalities of law. I hear the average conservative accuse the American Civil Liberties Union of being sympathizers with criminals, communists, etc. It would be fairer to criticize the police for being enemies of the constitutional law. \"If they can get away with it\" is not supposed to be jurisprudence. That is what criminals are accused of. The \"ends justifies the means\" ideology is what the bad guys are supposed to be rationalizing to themselves. When the police have to make up a crime in order to convict someone who they \"believe\" guilty of a different crime, and the judge and prosecutor let that happen, then, our system is corrupt. There wouldn't have to be rules to protect the innocent if the ability to go power mad and abuse the authority given them didn't happen on a regular basis. Anyone in the court system admits the idea of having a lawyer appointed to one's self by the court has been proved to be a joke since most people in the public defenders offices are overbooked and they merely make a pretense of actually giving the defendant a defense. Some of the police actually try to ignore of forget to read a suspect their rights from the card they are required to carry in their pocket and read to them. That card is called the Miranda/Escobedo warning. Most people don't realize that law came about from innocent people who were in prison who weren't read their rights, who weren't given proper jurisprudence and who, from a prison cell, changed our law and for instance, Ernesto Arturo Miranda, who was what is known as a \"jail house lawyer\", an inmate who goes to the law library and reads his actual rights, filed writs against the court and won. Miranda was convicted of rape and kidnapping and sentenced to 20 to 30 years imprisonment on each charge, with sentences to run concurrently. Because of the police not arresting him using proper procedure, he not only changed the law, he was released from prison for several felony counts. He admitted to things under duress and was never allowed an attorney before questioning, the same way you hear the police on \"Law and Order\" act like they are angry when a suspect \"lawyers up\" and act as if it is a bad or wrong thing. That prevents the police from otherwise extracting evidence under illegal means. The thing that most police organizations don't want you to know is, that the inmates who do research the actual law in their case end up going free as the court system can't prove the guilt of that inmate without legal improprieties that get swept under the rug during their day in court at the whims of a judge or in the case of the police illegally arresting or questioning someone. Could it possibly be that hard to follow the law of the same court they are an officer of?\n",
      "Can somebody who liked the movie please explain: - Okay so the military drops at least 2 smart bombs when they open one of the silo holes.... but at the end of the movie Dolph and Montel crawl out to greet the press and no visible damage??? - The bad guy is seconds from having his goal of blowing up Washington but for some unknown reason he uncuffs himself from the code suitcase and falls to his death.... thus allowing Dolph time to run to the lab and stop the bomb from exploding... gave me a headache trying to make sense of that - Dolph and one of the bad guys are fighting under one of the missiles when it launches and sprays them with superheated fiery compressed flaming exhaust ..... but Dolph picks himself up and fights on - the bad guy demands the poor President (that guy from Jaws)shoot himself on national TV in the graveyard.... but the gun on the headstone is full of blanks... so why not have a secret service guy bump off the President if it would save the country??? - I guess a nuclear bomb exploding in South Dakota was no big deal... just a warning... nothing real important - the rooftop car chase was interesting - at least have Dolph take his shirt off and show us his body\n",
      "First of all, the Tokyo Babylon manga is one of the most amazing things I have ever read. The characters were deep, sympathetic, and non-clichéd, and the story lines were very original. Congratulations to the ladies in CLAMP for creating such a beautiful story.<br /><br />That said, what on earth was this? Both of the Tokyo Babylon movies were more like bonus features - \"Okay, you read the manga, here's some other cool adventures they got up to!\" Which is a nice thought, but it really has no purpose. You cannot condense a series like this into a couple of movies - they tried it with X and it didn't work, they tried it with TB and it worked even less. There was none of the depth, none of the message, none of the character development - it turned into just another comic book, a collector's item.<br /><br />It was also rather irritating (TOUCHY SUBJECT ALERT) that half of the plot was ignored. Let's face it, folks, Tokyo Babylon is, in large part, a homosexual love story, learn to live with it. In the first TB movie, it seemed that Sakurazuka Seishiro's romantic advances were targeted more towards Sumeragi Hokuto than Sumeragi Subaru, and in this one, they were almost completely absent. Without this major part of the story, Seishiro is worthless - he becomes another clichéd villain.<br /><br />The animation was very pretty (as it always is in shojo) and the voicing couldn't have been better. Like I said before, it was a nice thought, but it simply isn't worth the trouble. 3/10.\n",
      "My original review was mean. Yeah, this show is stupid. The farm animals do stuff when the farmer isn't looking. If you want something that might make you smile, watch the movie. The show has is moments. It has progressed with humor, but still cliché. Personally, I don't like the show or the movie much, but this is something you can watch if there really is \"nothing on\". Nothing special, that's why it doesn't play much. This isn't a show trying to be nominated for an Oscar, so just sit back and watch. Let loose and enjoy yourself. If you laughed, admit it. Just because the majority of the show may not make you laugh, don't be so negative. Think positve. If you laugh, at least say you did.\n",
      "There are 8 letters to describe this show, H.O.R.R.I.B.L.E. It is not at all funny, and is just stupid. It seems like farm animals and 8 year olds made up this show, because it's really stupid and terrible. It's about animals on a farm that like to party and goof off when the farmer isn't around. Not a good concept, which is why I think an 8 year old is the director. I never, ever laugh at this show, unless I'm laughing for not good reasons because the show is so stupid and boring. You do not want to watch this show, trust me, unless you are stuck with one channel on your TV and this is what's on, and even then I'd just find something to do by myself.<br /><br />1/10\n",
      "I have an 8 yr old son whose TV viewing I monitor closely. I had never seen the movie version of \"Back at the Barnyard\", but having grown up on a Dairy Farm in WI, I thought the premise was cute and could see no harm in watching an episode with him, figuring it would be fine for him to watch.<br /><br />I agree that the subject matter tends to be fine and the cartoon is harmless for him to watch, but I can't get past the fact that Otis has a male voice and female parts!!!!! Does nobody realize or care that steers &/or bulls (boys) DO NOT have udders?!!!!!! Cows (girls) have udders.<br /><br />I realize that as a cartoon for kids this doesn't matter much, but it just irks me that we have become such a lazy viewing audience that we don't hold the creators of this cartoon to a little higher standards. Are we teaching our kids to be sloppy by not requiring minor things like the difference between boys and girls to be portrayed correctly?\n",
      "Dear Jesus,<br /><br />How could you??? How could you rip-off Claude Mulot's '75 \"Le Sexe qui parle\" in such a shameful manner, just switching from... \"main entrance\" to \"back door\" and think...you could get away with it? I can understand if, at the time you made this movie, perhaps you badly needed to make a quick buck to pay rent and bills but, at least you could try to do it with the style I (and many more) know you are capable of. I know it's \"hard-core\" but we all know you can do better then this. I can absolutely NOT forgive you for having \"thrown\" at us (audience), \"our\" lovely Lina Romay in tasteless and gratuitous gynecological poses and, to make things even worst, let her hide under that horrible wig, which made her look so cheap and vulgar. Where did you leave the atmosphere, the mesmerizing images, the erotic build-up and the style you got us accustomed to? Perhaps you tried to make it funny but, the only time I was able to smile, was when Lina/Lulú spots the \"Oscar\" statue sitting on top of a piece of furniture and decides quickly to put it...to use. First I thought this was your humorist way to give us your opinion about the \"Academy Award\" but, most probably, the statue was just found by the Prop-man somewhere in a box and he decided to bring it to the set, thinking that it may somehow fit in the plot.... Sorry Jesus, but this is definitely a NO-NO! I can only give a very merciful 3 out of 10 and, to get the bad taste out of my mouth, I'm going now to watch (again) \"Les Avaleuses\" or \"Doriana Grey\" and I hope it will help...\n",
      "This was far too one sided to be called a \"documentary.\" Really, it was more like propaganda! A little less \"evil corporation\" and a few more actual facts -- from BOTH sides -- would have made this a far more informational, effective film. After viewing it, I'm just insulted that the makers think I'm so lacking in intelligence that they can present this to me as a \"documentary\" with no questions asked. It is very obviously an opinion piece; label it as such! There are obvious appeals to emotion throughout the film; they could have been left out, and it would have raised the quality dramatically. There are several valid points made throughout the film of the problems that arise in corporations; it is disappointing that the makers felt the need to cloud those points with foggy emotional appeals. If they believe corporations to be so evil, present the whole story and I should be able to figure that out for myself.\n",
      "Part of a disturbing trend in recent film-making where complex ideas are expressed as propaganda rather given a fair airing. The film displays a complete unwillingness to understand economics. It includes comments by eminent economists only to mock them. It fails to understand Adam Smith's age old point that \"It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest.\" The film does contain kernels of truth and does package the ideas in an entertaining way, but by allowing no room for dissent, it is merely preaching platitudes to the choir.\n",
      "i was dragged out of my bed for this film and frog marched down to the local cinema where i paid my money and i intended to enjoy a film, which i was convinced would be in the style of Bowling for Columbine ... 3 hours later after i had sat through the same point being rehashed and retold to me by various people i ran outside with a splitting headache i had such high hopes for this film, the film had its heart in the right place but the director obviously didn't cut his film enough.<br /><br />i really do want to say something good about this film, so i will - it made a good point - i just wish it had not made it about 7 times, i do honestly believe this film could have been better had it been scaled back - i realise there is a lot to bring to the attention of the viewers but not at the expense of alienating them\n",
      "I guess we can thank Michael Moore for reviving the documentary, but it's unfortunate that I was sucked into paying to see this film.<br /><br />Did you realize that a corporation's primary goal is to, above all else, make money? Did you know that corporations do cost-benefit analyses for everything, and make decisions solely based on the results of those analyses?<br /><br />Is there a problem with that? I own a small company, and, yes, we are in business to make money. If we weren't making money, we would shut down the business.<br /><br />The agenda of the film is to inform, and possibly shock, viewers about the deeds of \"evil\" corporations. It didn't win me over. There's nothing new or shocking here. Save your money, or, rather, use it to go see the interesting and revelatory \"Going Upriver: The Long War of John Kerry\".\n",
      "This movie was just another piece of Moore propaganda. It fails to properly explain corporate structure, corporate governance, and even what a corporation actually is. In fact, it appears Moore lumps all corporations together and never distinguishes from publicly traded corporations and corporations such as Goodwill or private family corporations. There is no discussion of the Business Judgment Rule or even derivative suits. Moore's unsupported beliefs. I am trying to figure out how someone who invests so much money into publicly traded securities can make a movie that is directly in conflict with his behavior. When it comes down to it is lacks little educational value and is fairly boring.\n",
      "These people are so naive to believe that corporations are evil and that nationalizing everything is good.<br /><br />in North Korea, USSR, the Warsaw pact and China, everything was state property, were they utopias? Not by a longshot. <br /><br />In fact, the most deaths in the 20th century were caused by communism and the worst famines were in communist countries alongside the killing fields in Cambodia, persecution of the religious, the gulags among other things.<br /><br />As for the makers of the documentary. i would leave them a choice: where would you want to live? North Korea (communist, no corporations) or South Korea(corporations, freedoms etc.)?\n",
      "I like documentaries that point out the flaws with real world things such as corporations, but man, this movie pushed it way too far. I was intrigued at the cases they presented and the examples (such as the Monsanto dilemma), but this movie was unbelievably biased.<br /><br />I mean, this movie paints corporations as the devil himself and they don't realize one thing. If everyone turned against corporations (all are not bad), then we have no economic system. They serve a purpose and without them, you wouldn't have the luxuries you have. I say luxuries because we don't need it, but want it. That's what they do. Not only that, they employ us (for the most part). This movie makes it seem as though corporations should be boycotted as a whole, and that is wrong. This movie misrepresents a lot of things, but at the same time presents many useful things.<br /><br />I enjoyed the movie, except for the fact that it is way too biased for a documentary. It seems as though Michael Moore, who speaks in the movie, made it himself.\n",
      "If you can sit through this mess without wanting to vomit, i would say you either agreed with the slanted view of the world (that corporations are EVIL) or you hadnt gotten any sleep the night before and passed out during the film. It didn't even try to be fair, it was so one sided and filled with the typical liberal elitists (Michael Moore, Noam Chomsky, etc). The film winds up \"proving\" how evil corporations are by linking American corporations with Nazi Germany. Preposterous. Absolutely vile. It calls the organized anti-freetrade mobs that burned and looted \"grass roots\" - when they are anything but (you don't get 5000 people to spontaneously attack a free trade meeting without some sort of support, logistics, planning, etc). Bringing on a straw man conservative to \"rebutt\" their liberal agenda, only to have him say the most inane and moronic things, which are instantly crushed by the liberal propaganda spewers that dominate this film is shameful. It was disgusting, it was one sided, and it reminded me of the 1960's retreads that come out every now and again to rally people to their cause only to fall apart again once they realize no one is listening. It was just a pile of junk. Look at the writer and director, he has done nothing but make films with agendas time and time again. don't expect a fair fight, but please don't try to laugh when the nazi flags are paraded around and \"evidence\" shows IBM, the evil corporation, somehow helped kill millions of Jews. Give us all a break already, you aren't fooling anyone.\n",
      "Don't expect a balanced view from this movie. It is a highly biased propaganda piece, although there is some counterpoint scattered throughout. Micheal Moore comments that corporations are only after profits. The narrator announces that the corporation is bound to place profits of the stockholder above the public good. Noam Chomsky, throws in his radically left ideas as frosting on this bitter cake. He paints with a broad brush that even though the people working in corporations may be moral, the institution of the corporation is inherently evil.<br /><br />The movie points out that a corporation will move into an impoverished country and are hailed as a hero for providing opportunities for workers. When the pay rises and the workers start making additional demands upon the company, the documentary states, the corporations leave those workers behind in search of more worker to exploit. There's no denying that there is some truth to that. The balanced point of view is that those exploited workers have had an improved standard of living as a result. It is clearly not up to the standard of living in the first world, but it is an improvement.<br /><br />The movie progresses by creating a psychological profile of a corporation as through it were a person. The premise being the corporation is an amoral or immoral person. They even interviewed an FBI employee that profiles psychopaths. If course, they only look at the negative aspects of corporations.<br /><br />I know one of the experts interviewed, although I won't mention his name because he is tort-happy. I know his motivations are less than honest. He is out to make a name for himself.<br /><br />I am the CEO of a corporation. I am also a life-long Democrat. I have a blog on political moderation that advocates, among other things, reasoned debates on things of importance to our culture. There is absolutely no doubt that there are corporations whose culture is oriented toward the exploitation of people. There are also corporations, like mine, who have a corporate culture toward providing a service to customers. I am well compensated for the service I provide, but I enhance the value of companies I serve and I can serve them with honesty and integrity. Corporations have served to enhance the standard of living for all Americans, although at times in unethical ways. I was looking for a balanced review of the value that corporations have brought as well as things that need to be changed so that pure greed and unethical behavior in some corporations can be held in check. There was an opportunity to present some legitimate concerns about the affect of corporations, both positive and negative, but the producers passed on that opportunity. Ironically, the \"What Do We Need to Do?\" Segment on the Q&A bonus materials is a lot closer to the reasoned debate that I had hoped for in the movie.<br /><br />If you believe that corporations are inherently evil, this movie will be preaching to the choir. If you are looking for something other than propaganda, you will be disappointed by this film.\n",
      "Having just seen the terrific Fahrenheit 9-1-1, I was looking<br /><br />forward to this film. Alas. \"The Corporation\" is not really a film; it's<br /><br />a seemingly endless parade of monologue snippets with pathetic<br /><br />graphics in-between. In short, this is not a film. It reminds one of<br /><br />mid-20th Century \"educational\" films, but is not nearly as<br /><br />interesting. Ninety-five percent of this film is common knowledge<br /><br />(and if you don't know that corporations have taken over everything,<br /><br />then you are part of the reason why we have the evil government<br /><br />we have). Five percent contained new information. Alas, this film<br /><br />had no editor worth his or her salt. It was dreary beyond belief and<br /><br />after two hours, my friend (who reached the same conclusion as I<br /><br />did, but totally separately, since we do not talk during movies)<br /><br />looked at me, we got up and made our escape. Michael Moore<br /><br />has proved over and over that politics and information do not have<br /><br />to be dull. He knows how to use images to make his point. This<br /><br />documentary-maker doesn't.\n",
      "Irene Bedard looks great as she smiles through parochial school, which is described by Mary Crow Dog like this in her book: \"When I was a small girl at the St. Francis Boarding School, the Catholic sisters would take a buggy whip to us for what they called 'disobedience.' At age ten I could drink and hold a pint of whiskey. At age twelve the nuns beat me for 'being too free with my body.' All I had been doing was holding hands with a boy. At age fifteen I was raped. If you plan to be born, make sure you are born white and male.\" The worst we see of school is the cutting of the braids and louse powder. Mary Crow Dog described hellishly turbulent times in the book, yet the movie glosses over them. Racism, brutal living conditions, drunkenness and poverty, are all addressed in detail in the book, but sanitized for the viewer's protection in the film. All we see is Mary smoking cigarettes and refusing beer in the back seat of a car.<br /><br />The happily-ever-after ending of the film fails to address the many years and thousands of dollars it took to get her husband, Leonard, out of prison following the events. Oh, wait, the film didn't even show her marrying Leonard Crow Dog! Just a vague hint that he might be the father of her child.<br /><br />The book also describes many tribal customs and rituals that the movie glosses over, which makes it look like so much mumbo-jumbo, \"oh, look, they're dancing around in a circle,\" without any understanding of the significance to the Lakota people of the Sun Dance and Ghost Dance, which are covered in detail in the book.<br /><br />Although I like Irene Bedard and think she's a fine actress, I just don't think she conveys the rage and anger that leaps off every page of Mary Crow Dog's book. Ultimately, though, that rage isn't in the script for her to convey.<br /><br />Read the book.\n",
      "This flop never stood a chance of succeeding without Elizabeth Taylor's involvement, and if Liz ever saw this script she probably read 10 pages and winged it out the window with a noxious chuckle. What is meant to be a continuation of National Velvet, one of the best movies of the 1940's, is really a typical piece of slapdash 70's cinema. Any ties this story has to the original National Velvet, you feel, were contrived in re-writes to try and cash in in on some kind of marquee recognition. A film about equestrian riding starring Tatum O'Neal circa 1978 was only going to appeal to horse lovers and 12 year old girls.<br /><br />The story is hardly even or focused. The running time of 127 minutes could have been trimmed by at least a half hour to get rid of a pointless would-be romantic subplot, a potential gang rape, and about 15 minutes of endless riding shots (supposedly set at the Olympics of 1980, but the producers use footage from the 1974 opening ceremonies in Munich).<br /><br />Nanette Newman is adequate as Velvet Brown but her involvement in the story offers little more than comforting moral support for the first half of the film. She and beau Christopher Plummer are pretty much left behind when trainer Anthony Hopkins comes on the scene. Hopkins does a decent job with his role but still doesn't manage to breathe into the production more than a flicker of life. O'Neal is utterly cold and unsympathetic as the plucky teenage heroine. And like the pseudo-named author he creates in the film, Plummer phones his over-cheery performance in from long distance to collect a pay check. <br /><br />The only thing this film has really going for it other than Hopkins is the scenery.\n",
      "This movie has just been on UK BBC TV.<br /><br />When it started, outside it was snowing and the flakes were small and shardy. But, as time went by, they turned into quite large fluffy ones. There was quite a fair breeze too, blowing from the west. The weather forecasters have predicted that the flurries will be short-lived and followed by warmer weather with rain. So I don't think it will lie for long. It's a pity because we haven't really had any good snow in these parts for many a year.<br /><br />Must be something to do with global warming.<br /><br />Scotland, I believe, is the worst affected by the weather  it must be nice up there in the hills at this time of year.<br /><br />Then the film finished.<br /><br />I think it had horses in it.\n",
      "I noticed that the IMDB classes INTERNATIONAL VELVET as an American movie , this despite the fact it`s filmed in Britain , has a British director and an almost entirely British cast . Mind you it is funded with American money and produced by an American studio so by definition it is technically an American movie <br /><br />I guess that`s why INTERNATIONAL VELVET has such a typically American ethnocentric view of the English . Another reviewer has stated that everyone talks in ridiculous and posh accents etc and I totally agree , it`s laughable the way the Brits are portrayed in this movie though perhaps not as laughable as Tatum O`Neal`s \" English \" accent which is every bit as bad as Al Pacino`s \" Scottish \" accent in REVOLUTION . I guess if the heroine was played by a genuine English actress an American audience wouldn`t be able to relate to her <br /><br />INTERNATIONAL VELVET is a rather drab movie that`s best viewed on a boring Sunday afternoon which was when I saw it . I will give the movie credit for the scene where the German rider falls off his horse because for some unexplained reason I found this rather amusing in a movie devoid of amusement\n",
      "Guys, honestly - who rated this a 10? It was shocking and horrendous and as much use as a chocolate teapot. Such an awful storyline, shallow characters, poor plot development - I could go on and on.<br /><br />This is the first movie I have not liked Dustin Hoffman in, and Natalie Portman's performance is also poor.<br /><br />I hear you self-righteous b*stards from the back shouting \"But it's for the children...\" - er...if my children were on LSD, having eaten 2 spacecakes each, then perhaps this would have entertained them...<br /><br />I urge you not to watch this. Do not even waste your time - you will be begging for it to end. I can assure of that!\n",
      "Twenty five years ago, the young son of my theater directing professor, Mr. Valeriu Moisescu, while watching at the TV an extremely boring and tasteless comedy, remarked: \"Daddy, this movie is sorta stationery\" (in Romanian: \"stätätor\", as he said). \"I mean, it's not climbing up, like the beanstalk... It's missing a marble.\" Exactly the same is true for this completely unwonderful, unwondrous and unwondering \"emporium\". The script seems written by the worst dilettante (it's chaotic, messy and totally unconvincing). The direction is primitive and static, lacking spirit. Dustin and Natalie are as good as two junior high drama instructors playing next to their pupils. As to the kids themselves, they look amorphous and robotic. The only quality of the whole production is the colorfulness - rich, tasty, endearing. Don't you think it's a bit too little?\n",
      "i thought this was a truly awful film . Nothing in it made any sense , even by horror movie standards.The premise wasn't too bad but it just fell to pieces after the first 5 minutes its an Australian movie and the male actors have Australian accents but the women have these terrible fake American accents and one of the womens accent is so appalling i have no idea what country she is supposed to be from . the ending made even less , i presume it was to set it up for a sequel but there is no way this dog of a film would get the funding for a sequel . i was surprised it got the funding at all sense than the rest of the movie. after watching this movie i tried to find a way to get in touch with the director to sling some abuse , no other movie has driven me to that point before don't watch it unless your video store has a ' didn't like it? get your money back ' policy\n",
      "Silly cheesy horror movies, man how they make a Saturday night. You can pretty much tell from the box it comes in whether it's a dud or a gem in hiding. This one was of the former persuasion. The actors were capable and the overall production quality was good. But the STORY - that's where this falls into the toilet. It's not scary in the slightest, it's just a ripoff of that classic short story \"The Most Dangerous Game\" where a guy is trapped on an island trying to avoid some killer (there's even a pit trap just like in that story). In this case it's six people trying to avoid a killer<br /><br />---Spoilers follow ---<br /><br />who is revealed to us pretty much at the beginning of the movie in a flashback. They spend the rest of the time doing the stupid things people in every horror movie do - split up into smaller groups of 1 or 2 to make it easier for the killer to do his thing instead of staying together. You expect this in this genre but you at least want some tension, drama, or at least a \"boo\" moment or two. There's none of that here. Each person is dispatched very matter-of-factly without the slightest scare. The ending is incomprehensible and makes no sense - I didn't understand what happened to the two who got away and I didn't really care. Pass this one by, folks...\n",
      "Six former reality-TV stars (three female & three male) from 'Castaway Island' are whisked away to a seemingly deserted island for a reunion show. Once there, they're hunted and killed one by one. Could it be this Wesley guy that everyone thinks is crazy or someone else entirely? The better question is will you even care to find out one way or the other?<br /><br />Proving that America doesn't have a monopoly of unoriginal, hideously contrived, badly acted and scare free B-horror films, this Australian travesty rears it's ugly head to further trivialize and dumb down fans of the horror genre. This relatively blood-free, heavily clichéd mockery is deathly boring on top of all that and to add insult to injury, the ending doesn't make a lick of sense<br /><br />My Grade: F+\n",
      "Truly one of the worst movies I have seen in years. There is absolutely no tension, shocks or scares. The cast members are despatched in an entirely perfunctory and unimaginative fashion.<br /><br />The story and scripting is stupid beyond belief. At one point a character falls off a cliff and instead of trying to help him the girl he is with runs miles back to the camp to tell the others that he has fallen off a cliff. They don't actually decide to do anything about it and then seem entirely unsurprised when he shows up again with what appear to be only minor injuries (a bit of a cut on the side of his head). And how come the female actors have American accents (sometimes in some cases) whilst the males speak with Australian accents? And don't get me started on the ending. It makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.<br /><br />I have seen infinitely better low budget films produced by students.<br /><br />Avoid this at all costs.<br /><br />A pretty good cast wasted.\n",
      "It takes a long time for the film to get going. Not at all gripping, exciting or scary. I was very glad that there was nothing else on TV to watch. If you have seen The Breed then you have seen the better version of this film. If you have not seen it then watch it rather than this film. It is the type of movie that you watch to the end hoping that it will get better.<br /><br />The film actually gets going after about fifty mins, not that it's to going. The sound track is typical early nineties and the acting matches the soundtrack, Although this review is very negative, if you do watch this film for more than forty mins then keep going you may see a little blood...... Typical low budget cast and low budget effects.\n",
      "This kind of \"inspirational\" saccharine is enough to make you sick. It telegraphs its sentiments like the biggest semaphore on earth. It removes from the audience its own interpretation and feeling by making the choices for it. The big finish is swimming in weeping orchestration that must supposed to work like jumper cables on a dead car; I guess you'd need such prompting to feel if you're stupid enough to watch a film as simple-minded and sappy as this. Streep glows and you wonder if she really has the depth of feeling on display or if it's just that---a display, switched on and off like a light. Because I can't for the life of me see how she could possibly find life in such a dud of film. Even though it's based on a true story, and an inspirational one at that I'm sure, the set-up, execution and performances play like a third-rate TV movie or half-witted high school drama.\n",
      "I saw this movie at a 'sneak preview' and i must honestly confess that I do not like films with Meryl Streep that much. This picture was the worst. Half the theatre did not return after the break halfway the film. I couldnt blame them, if this wasn't a true story there had been absolutely no need for the second half of the picture. Just before the film goes forward in time about ten years I myself was expecting the credits to appear.\n",
      "What a horrible, horrible film. The worst collection of cliches I have seen in a long time. Not that I saw much. I left the theatre screaming after about 40 minutes in search of a stiff drink to soothe my nerves. Meryl Streep was awful as usual. How many hurt and tortured expressions can 1 person have? Aidan Quinn's talents were - as so often - totally wasted. And who told Gloria Estefan she could act? Trying to be polically correct this movie still enforces racial stereotypes. (Brave inexperienced lonely music teacher teaches underprivilegded kids violin in poor neighbourhood school). The kids weren't even cute! Just written in to suit the appalling script. Aaargh! Wes Craven really made me cringe for once. real horror this one!\n",
      "After seeing how so many critics have raved about this film, and how several put it at the top of their \"Best of 2002\" lists, I was looking forward to it. Unfortunately, I was pretty disappointed. The story poses an interesting concept. I won't spoil it, but basically, two men are in love with two women who are in comas. One man is obsessive, the other is \"the other man,\" but does not know this until after she is out cold. They develop a sort of friendship, which is complicated when one of them acts inaproppriately out of his obsession.<br /><br />There are also some creative \"surrealist\" moments in the film (particularly during the shrinking lover b/w portions), but I found them to be more flashy and \"oohh look he's being different\" than intelligent and thought provoking. The film also contains an abundant amount of female nudity, which after a while became gratuitous. It's greatest weakness however is a slow plot. It takes nearly half the movie until an interesting plot point hits-- not to mention that the cuts are far too slow. The images might be pretty, but that doesn't make them entertaining.\n",
      "What a disaster! Normally, when one critiques a historical movie, it's always fun to point out the inaccuracies that slip in, usually added by the writers to create more \"dramatic\" situations. However, \"Imperium: Nerone\" is a whole 'nuther kind of animal. In this movie you strain to find ANYTHING at all that is confirmed by the historical record amidst the farrago of nonsense and fiction presented as the life of Rome's bad-boy artist-emperor.<br /><br />And it's a pity, because Nero is one of the most fascinating of all the Roman emperors. His life was filled with enough tumultuous events and interesting people to make a really good movie. The producers of this mess chose another route, which leads only to head-scratching on the part of any informed viewer.<br /><br />Just a few examples: <br /><br />1. Nero is depicted as an 6-8 year old boy when Caligula has his father killed for treason, exiles his mother Agrippina, and sends the boy to be raised by slaves in the countryside. \"Ten years later,\" the story resumes just before the assassination of Caligula. Facts: Nero was born about six months after Caligula began his four year reign, and was only three when he was assassinated; Nero's father died of natural causes; Agrippina was briefly exiled for bad behavior, not treason; and Nero was not raised among slaves, but had the typical upbringing of a young member of the imperial family.<br /><br />2. Okay, according to the writers, Nero is now about 16 when his great uncle Claudius becomes emperor (in fact he was about to turn 4); Agrippina engineers the downfall of the empress Messalina and marries Claudius, who adopts Nero. Then he goes off to conquer Britain, and is poisoned by Agrippina soon after his victorious return. Nero is declared emperor, although he's still perhaps only 18 or 19 years old. Fact: Claudius conquered Britain in 43 A.D., two years after beginning his reign. He lived until 54 A.D. Nero should have been 31 years old by then by any normal chronology, but in fact succeeded to the throne at age 16.<br /><br />History tells us that there then followed the \"Five Good Years,\" where Nero ruled wisely and well under the tutelage of the philosopher Seneca and the Praetorian commander Burrus. This is shown -- sort of -- except that portraying the Roman Senate as opposing Nero's good measures is false. Senatorial opposition to Nero only commenced when he started to show signs of insanity and began killing Senators for real or imagined treason.<br /><br />3. Nero's mother Agrippina is the controlling sort, who murdered her uncle-husband to make her son emperor. After a while, Nero tires of her meddling and decides to kill her. In the movie, he sends his henchman Tigellinus to stab her to death. All true enough, but the reality was so much better! Agrippina was a survivor, and didn't go easily. Nero tried three times to poison her, but as an old poisoner herself she was savvy to all that, and he failed. Then he tried to crush her to death by collapsing the ceiling of her bedchamber, but that also failed. Next, he sent her on a voyage on a ship that was deliberately constructed to fall apart and sink; as it went down, she jumped into the sea and swam to shore. Finally, he had her stabbed to death. Now showing all THAT would have definitely improved this movie! <br /><br />Other errors abound: Nero's lover Acte was not a childhood slave-friend, she never repudiated him, and there is no evidence that she became a Christian. Nero did not commit suicide by slitting his wrists while sitting beside a lake. Etc. etc. etc.<br /><br />The sources for Nero's life are primarily the Roman historians Tacitus and Suetonius, both of whom were of the senatorial class hostile to him and his memory. But the evidence indicates that he remained very popular with the common people, unlike one of the final scenes where he is pelted by the mob with vegetables as he leaves the city to commit suicide.<br /><br />WHY did the writers and producers take an inherently interesting story with plenty of good stuff for any movie, and make THIS piece of crap? Oh, and did I mention how cheesy the sets and costumes were? Lol.<br /><br />One star, because there's no way to rate it lower.\n",
      "Perhaps, we are too much attached to great spectacles when we hear of antiquity brought to screen. Perhaps, we expect too much from these films. However, if we, as viewers, are offered far too little, what happens then? <br /><br />That is what I thought after seeing IMPERIUM - NERONE by Paul Marcus, a part of the production series on the Roman Empire. AUGUSTUS by Roger Young, the first IMPERIUM movie, included at least Peter O'Toole but what does this movie include?<br /><br />Hardly anything accurate. The historical errors are so serious that the movie changes facts and constitutes rather a distorted image of the Roman Empire than the true history. Throughout the movie, we see Nero young: young man during the allegedly long reign of Caligula, young man during the reign of Claudius and finally during his own (historically 14 year long) reign. And...he dies the same. According to the movie, Nero, born during the reign of Tiberius, lives for more than 40 years but looks to be in his late twenties when he dies... Continuity combined with made up history is the biggest problem of the movie, which makes it hardly logical, not to say reliable. Nero loses his father, is raised by slaves. At that time, his mother, Agrippina, is exiled by Caligula. Later, however, she suddenly marries emperor Claudius who already has big children with freshly married to him Messalina. At these moments of the movie, we see Acte (Rike Schmid), Nero's mistress. All right, it is historically \"accurate\"; yet, no source proves that she played such a decisive role in the rise of Christianity in Rome. In the film, she is not only a devoted Christian but even a witness of St Paul's miracle (he brings a young girl Marzia back to life). Besides, there was, historically, nothing like Nero seen on the court of Caligula since Nero was born in Caligula's 4 year long reign (A.D. 37-41). I understand that movies may change something but such an error makes the script absolutely unreliable! And many, many other shortcomings concerning content that are hard to enumerate but after 30 minutes of watching this film, I doubted whether I was watching a historical movie or a total fantasy.<br /><br />As for its artistic features which supply us with entertainment, they are equally lame as the history here is. The performances are artificial, the cast simply have beautiful faces but weak acting abilities. Perhaps, I am too much attached to Peter Ustinov or Charles Laughton in the lead, but Hans Matheson does not fit as Nero at all. He could have some of the good moments as an actor but never as the infamous Roman emperor. Is he an artist who burns Rome for a song? Is he a cynic who disguises the love to his relatives? Is he a cruel ruler who sacrifices the lives of thousands of innocent people for the sake of \"alleged justice\"? None of these. He is just a young man who does not know how to rule and, in the long run, begins to release the fire burning within himself... John Simm is out of place in this film as Caligula and absolutely inferior to other portrayals of the character. Elisa Tovati is only sexy as Poppaea; yet she could have been much much better. The costumes are inaccurate and the sets do not amaze. Low budget results in low effects and, consequently, low entertainment.<br /><br />But what made me most angry in this movie and, as a result, I give it 1/10 are some moments that are absolutely unacceptable:<br /><br />- the death of Poppaea and St Paul's talk with Nero at her dead body, <br /><br />- Claudius' mention of the current conquest of Britannia on the feast and soon his death (he conquered Britannia while Messalina was his wife much before his death), <br /><br />- Tigellinus killing Agrippina (Laura Morante), Nero's mother, <br /><br />- Nero's arguments in the speech to the senators, <br /><br />- finally, Nero's death - a calm day at the lake and an indifferent suicide that leads to a moral said by Acte \"Let us forgive him\"<br /><br />All in all, this film is a waste of time and is absolutely unneeded as yet another production concerning the Roman Empire. It's better to make one good film in 30 years than ten minor little ones in 5 years. 1/10 - should not have been made at all.\n",
      "\"Nero\" as the title of the movie is in Germany is a another attempt to show one of the most interesting Roman emperors, Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, better known as Nero. Although this attempt at least tried to show a more historic accurate Nero than the amusing but completely fictitious Nero Peter Ustinov played in \"Quo Vadis!\" it still is a major failure. And to those IMDb-commentators who still believe that Sueton and Tacitus propaganda is true, please read a book about Nero that was published less than 20 years ago. Nero did NOT burn Rome, this is proved! He did not murder Britannicus. He did not torture, kill and maim for pleasure, he was the first emperor who BANNED the gladiator fights. The movie still shows a lot of mistakes, errors and is by the way made in a really cheap style, especially the sets were cheap and unconvincing, the palace looking like some villa, the city itself looked like..well like a cheap set. The acting was between good and sub-par, the music nearly insignificant and the movie soon deteriorated after Nero became emperor to a rushed, bad edited mess without any clear narrative structure. So there still is the potential for an epic biography of Nero that shows the true Nero, who was one of the best emperors who ruled Rome, despite the lies of Sueton et al.\n",
      "For a good take on the Roman Empire watch the excellent BBC produced miniseries \"I, Claudius\". This just sucked. The acting was pathetic and you could almost see the actors looking at the camera. Hans Matheson was irritating. Cheese factor was so high that it promotes constipation with repeated viewings. Even Caligula was tame. I think this film was silently supported by \"religious\" groups who shall remain nameless ;). The overt tones of Christian favoritism and persecution were blatant if that gives any hint. Stay away what ever you do - the running time is so long that I was able to read Harry Potter's first book faster than the time it took to view this tripe.<br /><br />Italy has done better - don't let Hans cute face fool you. He is not a great actor...he is a great bore.\n",
      "\"Imperium Nero\" is the second movie of the series of six productions named \"Imperium\". I have already unfavorably commented the first one: \"Imperium Augustus\". This second TV movie produced and broadcast last weekend by the Italian state owned network has the same defects. In addition contains a considerable number of historical errors. Some examples: Nero is a child and Agrippina calls him: \"Nero, Nero\". At that time is name was Claudius. He was named Nero after his adoption. Nero did not meet Acte when he was young as in the movie but after his marriage with Octavia and his nomination to Emperor. When becoming Emperor his sons where not adults: Britannicus is one month old and Octavia one year old. And many many more. If you are fond of ancient roman history you can find yourselves other examples. \"Imperium\" series will continue with four more movies : \"Titus\", \"Marcus Aurelius\",\"Costantinus\" and\"The Fall of the Roman Empire\". Finally!\n",
      "Sorry if I disappoint anyone about what I am about to say to this made for TV movie. But, I paid money for the movie and turned out this movie is disaster. The directing is really awfully bad. But, after I looked up its information here, I realized there might be reasons for the low quality of directing and producing. Maybe they don't have budget, but anyway, Ang Lee's Sense and Sensibility had little money too but it turned out a hit. The director in this movie did really bad job in telling the story and the movie couldn't even keep up a rational continuity in itself. It keeps pulling me outta scenes. Maybe someone need to work hard on story line/ board. The dubbed sound is also awfully bad. My god.... Normally, I would appreciate every movie because behind it lie ideas and imaginations of an individual. but, this time I am just mad , \"I really wanna hit something HARD.\" ...Just don't do the job if someone can't fulfill it to its best. Bad arts (its' not even art, what is it? )really hurt people.\n",
      "I cannot comprehend how this picture was allowed to be made. It is mostly, if not completely, inaccurate so much so that the main character does not even resemble how history has him look physically. This movie made me go on the internet and go through my books to make sure I remember Nero's personality correctly. For God's sake, I have a book that lists Nero as one of the most evil person's of the world and the movie made me feel bad for him. I must say Aggrapina's character seemed close to my understanding of her, both physically and psychologically. Although, the actors all did a good job, the movie was terrible and I'm sure I will not watch any others made by this sorry team.\n",
      "The Blue Butterfly is 'inspired by a true story.' The true story involves a young boy apparently ill with terminal cancer, who goes to the South American jungle with a renowned entomologist in search of a blue butterfly. When they return, the boy's cancer has disappeared.<br /><br />The facts of the true story are dramatic and emotional moving. There is no need to embroider them. But that is just what the filmmakers do.<br /><br />I'm guessing, but my feeling is that what we see in the movie that is not in the original story is: (1) The scientist did not have a long-lost daughter (2) There was no romantic connection between the boy's Mum and the scientist (2) No little villager girl actually connected with the boy, or caught the blue butterfly (4) The scientist did not fall down a hole, forcing the boy to make his own way through the jungle.<br /><br />A boy goes to the jungle and comes back cured of cancer - but the story is deemed not 'dramatic' enough by the idiots who pose as story experts in Hollywood. This film is a schmaltzy, overblown insult to the intelligence. Great stories are not about ticking off the boxes in some script reader's manual. There is a genuine, uplifting tale buried in this film, that somehow got lost as each executive decided to burp out a script note after lunch. The end result is an unedifying, distasteful meringue of a film. I was insulted.\n",
      "It was terribly boring. The soundtrack was woeful - some shots would have come to life much better with dramatic and more moving scores.<br /><br />The dialogue was predictable.<br /><br />Were they targeting an adult audience or kids? I was lost. It was not entertaining.<br /><br />The only reason I kept watching was that I ate dinner late and I needed to let it digest before going to bed. Otherwise I would have been in bed 60 minutes ago.<br /><br />They must have had a shock after the edit. \"Gawd, how are we going to sell this?\"\n",
      "I thought the film even with the dramatization was compelling, but unfortunately the scriptor and director forgot or ignored the end of the film by simply ending the story with a cute Voice Over, and tracking shot of the young boy running into the fade out. There were basic errors in story telling, and some times you have to give the audience what they want or perceive to want. example: It would have been good to see the doctor meet up with his daughter. It would have been good to see or read a bio of the young boy's life in 2004 as the story was written about his life in 1987. <br /><br />The audience is always right. . .hence the film's pitiful 1.7mill box office.\n",
      "terrible. probably one of the worst movies i've ever seen. we figured that they got william hurt to act in this turkey by either paying him buckets full of money, or he wanted to go to the jungle and figured this would be a free trip, or he's part of the cult. because it must have been a cult that financed this movie. i don't know the cult of the healing power of the blue butterfly, or the jungle, or the big hole in the ground that they fall into. we watched this movie imagining if the guys from south park had written it and cartman was the little kid faking his lines so he could get a free trip to the amazon. there's one scene where they're swimming by the waterfall that's almost like nambla. jeez, have i written enough lines yet?\n",
      "This is one of the most unconvincing, most terribly directed movies I've watched in a long time. It's so unprofessionally done, it's almost like a student movie. The story has some potential, I admit it's not the most predictable plot line, and some actors are quite good in their roles (Walken & Schlatter have some good chemistry), but scenes which are supposed to be scary are so badly done they come across as hilarious. Some scenes are so out of place and so unconvincing you find yourself thinking it's going to be a dream scene and the character will wake up, but no, it's for real. Then you just can't believe it. Background music is terrible. Character motivation is dubious. Many people's actions simply don't make any sense. It's basically C-production.\n",
      "Christopher Walken: what was he doing in this movie? What was he saying? The only thing this movie succeeded in, besides making me lose faith in Anson \"Potsie\" Williams filmmaking career, was making me feel sleazy. Everybody in this movie looked too cleancut to be involved with all that sex and I don't think there was a \"Blue Velvet\" double meaning of looking beneath the surface either.\n",
      "Another movie with Christopher \"There's a clause in my contract that says I have to be in at least one scene of every movie\" Walken where he wastes his talent. <br /><br />All-American Murder is a pretty pathetic movie, especially the ridiculous ending. I would compare it to 'Blue City,' the Alley Sheedy/Judd Nelson \"thriller\" about some fast talking cocky kid who wants to avenge his father's death. But, he never stops with his cocky, mouthing off, even in the face of a mafia and corrupt government officials. And his adversaries only react with stupid, empty threats. Where's the action? Where's the suspense? <br /><br />Like it was in 'Blue City', the main character (Schlatter) and many of those around him react too unbelievably, given the situation they're in, making it one laughable, ridiculous movie. <br /><br />The story centers on Schlatter, who plays a similar fast-talking, cocky kid, but a well-meaning one. A student a college, he tries to sweet talk one of the sorority girls into going out with him. But, unfortunately, he should've just settled for 'no,' because when he shows up one night, she bombs out of the building and burns to death. And since he was the only one around, he must be the culprit. Well, surely a misunderstanding such as this calls for ample chase scenes, as Schlatter tries to prove his innocence, especially with a cold cop breathing down his neck and giving him a deadline, basically, before he hauls him into jail, his patience wearing thin.<br /><br />But, neither the killer's identity, nor the motives, nor the finale, are all that interesting, and the end is just plain stupid. At least if the rest of the movie were just simply mediocre (it is actually worse than that), than a strong ending might've saved it. But it didn't. Not at all.<br /><br />I can see why Schlatter was in this movie. This is basically his schtick--the happy-go-lucky charming guy who tries to get the girl (see 18 Again!), and he's good at it, except this kind of story doesn't call for that kind of character throughout the whole movie. Everybody seems to be too passive in situations that require emergency, making the whole thing seem pretty stupid. Schlatter's good nature humor may've worked if there was anything really going on in the story. But there isn't. And of course, just because Christopher Walken is in a movie, doesn't make it a good movie. Here, he is a good actor in a bad movie. <br /><br />If it's thrillers you're in the mood for, even cheap ones, I'd recommend looking elsewhere.\n",
      "This movie was generally watchable as long as you kept in mind that it was a CHILDREN'S movie. Even so, I found some problems with it, and it certainly did not stack up to the original. First, the special effects were not quite as good as in the original. Second, the majority of the main characters were young, inexperienced, and naive. Only Goeff seemed to have some sort of interesting background, but he never elaborated on it. Lastly, the ending left much to be desired. At the last moment, the bad guy reveals a secret that was never even hinted at during the rest of the movie. The king is never shown to come out of his stupor. It's no surprise that the dragon saves the hero's life (that was telegraphed from the beginning). Nobody gets the girl (in fact, they never show her saying goodbye to the hero). All in all, the movie was a disappointment.\n",
      "I enjoyed the first Dragonheart very much. This new one was certainly inferior to the first, but I found it worth my time. It was released straight to video and that is a obvious sign of lacking. It was short and the plot was fairly shallow, but it did have it's moments especially comedic ones.<br /><br />It doesn't do the original justice, but its still fun\n",
      "Hmm... it doesn't follow the story very well. Guys don't lay eggs. Draco's death was significent because it was to be the last dragon's. And, the content of A New Beginning deserves a G rating.<br /><br />Seriously, the dialogue was simply childish. Like, \"Wow,\" and \"I don't wanna leave!\" So yeah, this was pretty fake in and out. The first one had a serious storyline and was awesome to watch. But watching a baby dragon spit fire out his butt, spit on someone from a mile away, to be taught to breath ice, you can't possibly be thrilled by that.<br /><br />Next thing, the special effects were miserable. When Drake breathed \"ice,\" it was was like seeing a bunch of kindergarteners throw chunks of styrafoam as a wall!\n",
      "Severely flawed sequel to an amusing and beautiful original. The CGI dragon is very well animated but the lighting is all wrong and the voice acting is pitiful (not to mention the regular acting). The original film relied heavily on the charisma of Sir Sean Connery's voice(!), so it is no wonder that this film lacks the charm of its predecessor. The film seems aimed towards kids and possibly young teenagers who tend to be somewhat underdeveloped in the intellectual department. The whole production has the feel of a 'Young Hercules' episode (especially the campy martial arts sequences), which is not a compliment...<br /><br />NeofreemaN out.<br /><br />\n",
      "This is one of the movies i really, really hate. The plot is so generic and clichéd, it made me cringe in embarrassment. Stableboy ascends to hero and, with the help of his dragon and a few Chinese Kungfu-fighters (who looked like they were outfitted in a bad costume shop), overthrows the evil usurper, who happens to be another dragon. The twists were highly predictable, the ending disgustingly saccharine. To make a bad movie worse, the PG-Rating took the last drop of seriousness from the movie, leaving a witless comedy for handicapped toddlers. What can i say, there are no redeeming qualities in this under budgeted, soulless mess, except for the score which was a rehash of Randy Edelmans magnificent work.\n",
      "It caused me physical pain to watch this movie. Not only was some of the acting terrible, and the effects were cheap, but Drake was ugly (C'mon, he's essentially Draco and the Scarred one's kid, and we all know how lovely Draco was). The plot was sub par, and the dragons were terrible. The FULL GROWN dragon was about 1/4 the size of Draco.<br /><br />This movie MAY have had the possibility to NOT SUCK if it had a bigger budget and a better script. I wouldn't let my kids watch this. I'd watch the first one with them. Honestly this shouldn't have happened. Don't even get me started on how many shots they took from Dragonheart, and they bastardized the old code. The Dragons looked very very fake, and the fact that the first movie was made in '96 and had much much better effects shows the lack of care put into the sequel. I gave this movie a chance, against my better judgment, thinking \"It can't be THAT bad.\" But it was. The Bad guy was too cliché, and not the kind of bad guy that David Thewlis was in DH. It was a travesty, and nothing can be done to save it. Children should not be allowed to watch it. <br /><br />Oh, and taking the music that Randy Edelman wrote and using it throughout it not going to save it. Yeah. I'm sorry but I could not STAND this movie.\n",
      "I loved the first Dragonheart.<br /><br />I threw a party last weekend, and saw this movie for sale in Wal-Marts \"$5 and under movie\" bin. I regret I ever took it out.<br /><br />The story goes that after Draco. \"Last of the Dragons\" died, he reveals a gift to Bowen before he dies, a dragon egg. If Draco was last of the Dragons, where the H*** did the egg come from? So the young Dragon, named Drake grows up in Brother Gilberts monastery basement/dungeon area thing. A young boy, Geoffery, goes down into the dungeon, where he befriends Drake.<br /><br />enter the generic bad guy who toys with he boy's dreams and convinces him to become a knight. Enter the two stereotypical Chinese old Kung-Fu master and apprentice who turns out to be a girl sent to kill the last evil dragon, who is in the form of a man.<br /><br />Guess what, the bad guy IS the Dragon! SHOCKER! He and Drake fight i the air, despite the above-average special effects for its time, it was rather boring. the evil Dragon, Griffin, breaths fire. Yhen, out o nowhere, Drake masters the ability to breath ice and freezes Griffin, who shatters into a million pieces when he drops 30 feet from the air. One of the ice shards hits Geoffery.<br /><br />Huess what, he gets half of Drakes heart, they become heroes, and everyone is happy.<br /><br />WAY TOO HAPPY! The first Dragonheart was an action-fantasy epic, this movie is just a dull kids version. 2/10<br /><br />Three people left he party during the movie because it was so horrible. Let your younger siblings see it, you just wont love it\n",
      "*MAYBE POSSIBLE SPOILER* Sorry, but I'm afraid to say I disliked this movie. I've seen Dragonheart many, many times (which isn't really a children's movie), but when I saw this one, was surprised to see that's what it is. A children's movie, I mean. No appearance by Pete Postlethwaite doesn't help, either. And since when did dragons breathe ice? You'd think the fire and ice would cancel out or explode or something, but anyway, If you liked Draco in Dragonheart, see this one because Drake (The young dragon) is the only similarity to the first film. And even then, only marginally. 1.5 out of 5.\n",
      "This is a bad, bad movie. The original Dragonheart was no Oscar winner, by any stretch. Not a bad movie, but certainly not great. In truth, it did not warrant a sequel. Yet, despite this, A New Beginning still manages to do the original no justice by being a total flop. The plot, acting, and directing are all bad. Don't bother with this one.\n",
      "For those of you who saw the first Dragonheart, which was a WONDERFUL MOVIE and I suggest you see it, you should know the second one makes VERY LITTLE SENSE.<br /><br />Point A. If Draco was the LAST DRAGON, how are there other dragons now?! There's like a million of them running around in China or something! Point B. After Draco died he completed the constellation Draco, so tell me if it's completed because the last dragon is there how are there other dragons?!<br /><br />I thought this movie was lacking plot, good acting, and it made little sense prior to the first movie. I give it two thumbs down.\n",
      "Four years after original Dragonheart movie, which I liked a lot Universal released on video this cheap and rather pathetic sequel. I saw it a few days ago and it was far below my expectations, although it wasn't completely a bad movie. If you don't expect too much and don't take it too serious it can be at least watchable and even entertained. But that's all about it. <br /><br />There is no intelligent story and no true atmosphere of medieval age as it was in Dragonheart. Actually, the story is poor and it has the certain lack of emotional appealing. The characters development was totally forgotten and with pathetic villains, Asians and Kung-fu in the middle of medieval Europe, ice-breathing dragons, silly jokes and worst of all with ridiculous ending A New Beginning was unable to bring to its audience a memorable and well-constructed story.<br /><br />The same was with the cast in the movie. It looks like the studio was counting every buck making the movie and no one actor and no one character from the original movie didn't return for the sequel. Even if I mostly liked Chris Masterson in his part in Malcolm in the Middle TV series, his choice for the lead character was totally ineffective. Maybe because of his lack of acting experience he was very unconvincing and unable to wake up the audience. Even visuals were unoriginal and poor. It's a case when the term \"unnecessary sequel\" instantly and unintentionally came to mind without any invitation. Dragonheart: A New Beginning is a typical example of making cheap, uninteresting movie sequel and burying the franchise.<br /><br />Grade 4 out of 10.\n",
      "Well, given that the first Dragonheart was no Citizen Kane - heck, it wasn't even an Excalibur in itself - my expectations were low for this movie. And those expectations were met in full. Dragonheart: ANB builds on the contrivances of the first and offers its own; now there's a new semi-evil ruler guy (you'll love his beginning speech decreeing that citizens must always speak the truth), a new convenient dragon (whose 'ice lung' ability is just a little too powerful) and a wimpy hero who learns to deal between the two, sort of.<br /><br />One of the more humorous things about ANB is its unnatural PG rating, which means swordfights and such must be bloodless. It makes many of the fight scenes more laughable than they are naturally, which is considerable already. And it gives no particular creedence to the inevitable dragon-heart-changing-sequence, which you know must be coming - you just don't quite know where. Sigh. I shouldn't waste much more time on this. It's a fun dumb movie, but don't expect much more from it. At least they didn't contrive a romance between the hero and the 'foreigner' bodyguard, who is quite clearly female but at whom every character seems surprised to discover this fact.\n",
      "Seriously, when I first saw the styling of the new baby dragon, I expected it to swallow a turtle any moment on the way and sprout angel wings. It looks too much like Yoshi, like a baby and the sad thing is that I have yet only talked about the dragon.<br /><br />Christopher Masterson and Robby Benson are spectacularly out of talent during this lot, a spineless cast trying to bare the weight of complete and utter failure. The underdog recipe has been tried honestly for over a thousand times, on twenty different types of movies, but in most cases, this one included, it does not inspire pity nor does it add something to the experience of watching this.<br /><br />Then there are the brace of peeps that watch this thing for its special effects; trust me when I say that they are quite bad. So... is there anything at all making it you worthwhile to watch this? <br /><br />No.\n",
      "This \"movie\" is just AWFUL! Sequels like this should be forbidden, because such movies are just made, because the original Film was a Blockbuster. I hate movies that destroy the spirit of the first film. Highlander 2 is another good example for that. Bad Animation, ridiculous Actors and Story (Asians in the medieval Europe...). To the middle ages: Where the original did a great job creating an quite authentic atmosphere etc. this thrashy rip-off felt more like an pumped up version of xena or this absolute horrible new adventures of robin hood series which should also be forbidden.\n",
      "Don't be fooled by anything that you have ever read about this movie, no matter how good someone has said it is. There is NOTHING good about this movie. I won't bother getting into the story, but I will say that the story is horrible, the end makes you say \"who gives a crap?\", there is barely if any gore at all in it, and this might very well be the worst movie ever put on film.<br /><br />I bought the DVD for $3 (US), and I feel as though I've been ripped off...that alone should give you an idea how bad it is--and it's not the kind of bad horror movie that is so bad it's good. This just goes beyond bad. I could never explain how horrible this movie is.\n",
      "Don Julio Madariaga, affectionately called the centaur, spoke this word of wisdom.<br /><br />The movie which presumably boosted Valentino's career or something definitely belongs to the silent trash. It seems uninspired and insipid in the extreme; it might have his fans but there are plenty of sick people nowadays. But it did some service, it brought me back on earth by reminding me that the silent masterpieces I used to digest are not the whole silent cinema. The silent garbage, as this Valentino flick proves, was as vile and unappealing as the later one.<br /><br />FOUR HORSEMEN has one of the ugliest casts ever. Most of the performers are ridiculously ugly.<br /><br />Rudy Valentino was perhaps a moderately goodlooking boy; the rest of the performers in the FOUR HORSEMEN's cast are extremely unappealing. The movie is clumsily made; I have forgotten how bad a silent movie can bethe Valentino vehicle reminded me. It might of meant something in Rudy's career; but it's ugly and mishandled. The caricaturing of the Germans is absolutely sickening.<br /><br />I have seen mostly masterpieces of the silent; this one belongs to the garbage league; a piece of anti-militarist and antiGerman propaganda, insipid and uninspired.\n",
      "I watched this movie for two reasons--Robert Mitchum and Zachary Scott. Now for anyone who loves classic Hollywood films, there's really no reason to explain in depth my reason to watch a Mitchum film--after all, he's Robert freakin' Mitchum--a wonderful actor who made everything (even crap) quite watchable. As for Zachary Scott, while he's far from a household name, I loved how slimy he could be--and when I read he was playing a guy who's selling guns to get rich during the Mexican Civil War of the 1910s, it sounded like a role PERFECTLY suited for him. Sadly, however, both actors were pretty limp here--particularly Scott. And, on top of that, the writing really was pretty sad.<br /><br />The film starts with Scott making a deal with the Federales (troops of the Mexican government). His wife (Ursula Thiess) obviously doesn't like him very much and seems to be biding her time with him. Robert Mitchum, another American, wanders in--apparently to scout out the situation. Soon, he leaves and walks right into a nearby battle between the Federales and the Revolutionaries. Now this part of the movie is really, really dumb. Seeing Mitchum casually strolling about the town with thousands of whizzing bullets flying about was really silly. How could he avoid the bullets?! I guess Mitchum must have been wearing bullet-repellent underwear. In a fit of boredom (or perhaps it was because the bullets broke his bottle of booze), Mitchum decides to stop merely watching the fighting from his balcony and tosses out a few grenades--endearing him to the Revolutionary leader (Gilbert Roland).<br /><br />A bit later, Mitchum and Roland hit on a scheme to kidnap Scott and his sultry little Wiener Schnitzel (Thiess). At this point, you'd think the film was going to improve following the dopey scene where Mitchum is taking a stroll through a war zone, but it actually will eventually lead to the film completely falling apart for me. Mitchum is supposed to be a self-centered mercenary....yet he throws it all away to spare Scott's wife from being killed. This made no sense at all, nor did Roland's decision NOT to shoot Mitchum in the face for doing this (in direct opposition to his orders). And the last portion of the film was pretty much all action and by then I was ready for the next film! By the way, while Miss Thiess is NOT a household name and only made a few American films, this German actress caught Robert Taylor's eye and they married--and remained married until his death in the late 1960s.\n",
      "How can a movie be this noisy and still put me to sleep? Is it the writing, which would have me believe:<br /><br />o An adventurer with seeming inexhaustible amounts of money would risk life and limb to GIVE away tons of arms and ammunition to `the revolution'? o That rebels would ride off and leave machine guns and light artillery pieces behind? o That Robert Mitchum, a prisoner scheduled to be shot, could hide two hand grenades in his jacket? o That Ursula Theiss, held hostage by seasoned rebels, would be allowed to keep a gun in her purse?<br /><br /> Ursula Theiss (Mrs. Robert Taylor) is pretty, but her love scenes with Mitchum lack spark. Far better is the interplay between Mitchum and Gilbert Roland, as well as his scenes with Zachery Scott and José Torvay (Gonzalez). In fact Mitchum's scenes with practically everyone but Theiss are better than his with her. Not very smart when the plot devices hinge on the Mitchum / Theiss relationship.<br /><br />Dull, dull, dull, and LOUD!\n",
      "I've been frequenting YouTube a lot lately in order to search for various movies I'd like to see that happen to be in the public domain (and many that aren't that haven't been taken off). Many of these movies are shown in segments that last little more than ten minutes each though there are some exceptions like this one that was shown in its one hour, seven minute entirety. It's one of the few surviving films of Theda Bara who is a pioneer as an alluring sex symbol of the movies. Here she likes to take happily married rich men and play with their emotions for the fun of it. Having said all that, while I found Ms. Bara's vamping pretty entertaining near the end, the first 30 minutes of A Fool There Was almost put me to sleep since that time mainly concerned the man she was fooling with's family. It probably didn't help that many messages that were shown on screen were mainly blurry. So for that, I'd only recommend A Fool There Was for any silent movie buff out there. P.S. This is the one with the famous inter-title card \"Kiss Me, You Fool!\"\n",
      "Watching this today is akin to taking a trip in a time machine. That is, to a time when a snub or a peccadillo had serious social consequences, when an exposed ankle was suggestive and daring, and when the presence of an assertive, sexualized vamp had power to shock us.<br /><br />Sadly, however, this scores low on the scale of cinematic value; whatever luster it once had isn't evident today.<br /><br />The story itself is a simple, if lurid, morality play, and nothing more. The intertitles are designed to lead us to the inevitable \"see what happens!\" conclusion. Nowadays, we expect a bit of irony, a degree of ambivalence.<br /><br />Likewise with the cinematography...all quite straightforward storytelling, with no narrative games. The filter color changes don't denote anything. In short, this is a depleted asset.\n",
      "Before I even start I have to tell you that I had to stop watching the movie before it was over because it was THAT terrible. there's a bunch of people in ireland, and there's a puppy that's about to be drowned, and all of a sudden they move to africa, and the same people are all there, and people whip their servants, and dogs fight with imprisoned baboons, and oh there's a love story, too. and lots and lots of animal violence. you know those family-type movies they show you in elementary school that are all about the sepia tones and the people on farms who do senseless things? well, this is like those, but worse. far, far worse. family movie my toe.\n",
      "Scorpio was a film Burt Lancaster didn't think too much of according to a recent biography and after viewing it I can certainly see why.<br /><br />On the plus side Lancaster got to work with former co-stars Alain Delon from The Leopard and with Paul Scofield from The Train, both films considerably better than Scorpio. Too bad he wasn't given something better than a warmed over espionage story.<br /><br />Lancaster is a CIA agent suspected of being a double agent. Word has come from on high to terminate his existence. Not an easy task by any means. Lancaster hasn't survived in the spy business by being a dummy for thirty years.<br /><br />From French intelligence the CIA borrows hit-man Alain Delon who has worked and trained with Lancaster. He's got the title role as one nicknamed Scorpio because of the way he strikes. <br /><br />Lancaster has an ace or two up his sleeve also. An old friend with the KGB, Paul Scofield, is willing to help up to a point.<br /><br />Here's where there is a real problem. Both Lancaster and Scofield are identified by the script as having served in Loyalist Spain with 'volunteer' groups. Of course in the Soviet case I'm sure volunteering was strongly urged.<br /><br />In America however that would have been the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. And during the post World War II McCarthy era that was one of a group of organizations past and present that was considered a Communist front. <br /><br />I'm sorry, but there ain't NO WAY that Lancaster with that in his background would have ever gotten a job with the Central Intelligence Agency. And if he did, he would have been found out and dismissed back then and there. The whole story falls apart knowing this.<br /><br />There are some nice location shots of Vienna and of Washington, DC in Scorpio and acting honors if any go to Paul Scofield. But the film is one colossal waste of time.\n",
      "Michael Winner must hold the crown for Most Successful Awful Director in film history. With a string of pedestrian Charles Bronson action films to his \"credit,\" and really godawful pictures like FIREPOWER, THE SENTINEL, WON TON TON, THE DOG WHO SAVED HOLLYWOOD, and that astoundingly misbegotten remake of THE BIG SLEEP, I've never understood how Winner kept being allowed to make A-budget pictures. Now I've seen SCORPIO, and I can't understand why he was allowed even to keep making home movies! This is a painfully amateurish film starring several fine actors in what must have been an humiliating experience all around. Every line of dialogue in the movie is looped (dubbed after the fact), destroying any sense of authenticity and verisimilitude. The plot isn't complex enough for one of those comics that comes wrapped around bubble-gum, and technically the film looks like one of those local used-car dealer commercials in a small town. I've been studying Burt Lancaster's career lately, trying to catch up on every film of his I hadn't already seen, yet I couldn't stick this one out quite to the end. If that's being unfair to a picture that turns into a masterpiece in the last few frames, forgive me. There was nothing prior to those frames to indicate even basic competence on the filmmaker's part, much less a potential masterpiece. I've only quit in the middle of three movies in my whole life. This was the third.\n",
      "And I guess it will be me... This is a plodding film of dysfunctional characters that bored me with their dull, pathetic lives. Every part of this film is at fault here, from the endless anachronisms for 1979 (houses with vinyl siding not available until the 1990s, references to the Falkland war in 1982, Princess Diana style puffed sleeved party dresses from 1981...) to the Alec Baldwin Long Islander bad dad character he has pulled out of his hat on several B movie occasions. This film does not have the depth or pathos of American Beauty nor the intelligence or humour of Juno - two films it is commonly held up to. I have no idea why there seems to be a small but enthusiastic following for this film as I only felt relief when it was finally over. I gave it 2, only because there weren't more Caulkins in it.\n",
      "Derick Martini's direction here is adequate and the actors pour their hearts in some of the roles but the story the Martini brothers came up with fails to compel. As a result, this is just yet another bland indie entry mixing social criticism and coming of age stories. <br /><br />The story is down to earth but lacks visceral qualities and is rather forgettable. Character development is nowhere to be seen. It's even worse as far as the story is concerned. This one brings nothing new despite being well-made. <br /><br />One would be better off picking an old classic such as The Ice Storm in this case.\n",
      "If you like Bullit, well, you'll find the same stuff here : a good cop doing his job whose colleagues are often corrupted. Great. I remember how Steve McQueen used his gun in \"Bullit\" : he didn't shoot even once. Here, the actor and director Fred Williamson kills quite the whole city, to get evidences of stuff we don't understand clearly. The bad point is that it is a bad movie. The good point is that it's so low budget that takes are not done again when an actor reads his script on paper or when others start to laugh in a crucial moment...\n",
      "Nothing original in this film. All these bad scenes have appeared in movies for years. The plot is bad, the acting is bad, the timing is bad. Even Gary Busey, who usually gives a good effort, seemed to be sleepwalking through this one. The good guys and the bad guys were so alike that the only person you feel confident cheering for is Bubba Smith.\n",
      "It's craptacular!! More of the same from Fred Williamson. He's the renegade cop, somebody is dead, and now he's out for revenge. Too bad he couldn't track down a decent story while he was at it. Instead we're forced to watch while he charms the ladies, smokes cigars, and holds his shiny gun. If you're looking for anything beyond cliche'd characters, flat acting, and blaxploitation rehash, this film is not for you. But if you're up for Bubba Smith's toupee, a pack of geriatric cops \"chasing\" good ol' Hammer, and more plot holes than you can shake a stick at, this one might be right up your alley.\n",
      "I am a firm believer in watching an entire movie before you render an opinion. I almost had to break my own rule while watching this atrocity. I don't know what the point of this movie was, other than to make sure Williamson had one more rogue cop, one man army, thumb your nose at whitey, movie under his belt. Final summation: avoid this like the plague!\n",
      "The only thing \"slick\" about this film is the video box cover. The movie is strictly Grade B material, although there are some nice special-effects and color to it. The lead actor is probably what gives this movie such a lower-grade feel to it. Kevin Sorbo, who has not exactly become a household name among movie actors, shows why as he plays \"Kull.\" He doesn't look and he doesn't sound like a man from the medieval ages. Only his acting is medieval!<br /><br />The stupid dialog didn't help him, either. The sorcery with stupid doses of political correctness made the whole thing ludicrous. The leading lady wasn't any better: a broody, unlikeable Karina Lombard. You'd be better off with the horrible Steve Reeves Hercules movies of the 1950s - similar sort of thing.\n",
      "Some films are mediocre, some films are bad, but still other films are so misconceived and poorly executed that the film-makers should be embarrassed of themselves. \"Kull\" is exactly that film, and it's more fun to laugh at its unintentional idiocy than to make any attempt to take it seriously as fantasy. At any rate the film-makers also took care of that possibility by filling the sorry affair with so much contemporary humor in a pathetic attempt to imitate the formula of the \"Hercules\" TV show that starred the same \"actor\" who appears in this film, Kevin Sorbo.<br /><br />It didn't have to be this way. King Kull is one of the more interesting characters created by the legendary 1930s pulp writer Robert E. Howard, famous for Conan. Howard's writing has been mostly insulted and degraded by these film versions -- but this one is so awful it makes \"Conan the Destroyer\" look like \"Lord of the Rings.\" It makes \"Red Sonja\" look like \"Jason and the Argonauts.\" And it makes \"Conan the Barbarian\" look like \"Citizen Kane.\" I actually paid to see this in the theater because I'm such a big Robert Howard fan. It was so disappointing that I had to give it a spin on DVD just to see if it could really be as bad as I remembered it. It's far worse than any memory can convey. Right away, you have probably the worst music I've ever heard in a film, a combination of mock-Wagner and mock-Megadeth. Electric guitars on the soundtrack are an especially poor harbinger for a film supposedly set in ancient history. Then you start to notice that all the characters look like roadies for Spinal Tap, and the main villain dude has a mullet that would make Billy Ray Cyrus jealous. So maybe it all makes sense in a twisted way... apparently this was a demographic they were shooting for; perhaps they even advertised this film on WWF smack-down.<br /><br />There's no getting around what limits the movie the most -- basically the entire cast is wrong and incompetent. Kevin Sorbo always seems like a nice guy, and little else. He's all wrong to play a sadistic barbarian, but the film-makers have solved that problem by removing all traces of Kull's personality and all signs that he was created by Robert Howard, or you could say all signs that he was created by anyone other than a market research survey group. He's polite, soft-spoken, respectful of women, and he wants to free all the slaves. He's a hero -- a character who has no business in a Robert Howard story. Just once I'd like to see this great writer's stories rendered in a way that isn't just to turn all the characters into generic knights in shining armor. Doing that to his world and his characters is like making a Disney movie about the Donner Party. I can understand why a lot of people look down on writing like his, because they assume it's actually junk like this movie.<br /><br />It doesn't stop there, but I get too tired of thinking about it to go on. Sorbo is the least of our worries in the cast actually, considering that Harvey Fierstein is painfully hammy (and his character seems modeled on a dull character from the TV show), and the director seems to have thought it was a good idea to give all the heavy acting scenes to Tia Carrere. Her misbegotten performance lends the movie most of its laugh factor. This movie is cheap and ugly looking -- I would guess that they spent more money on the lame \"Merlin\" miniseries in the 90s than they did on this movie which was foisted on theater audiences. Not only that, but the director has no taste and no talent for cinema at all. Everything is shot in a bland and generic way so that none of it seems infused with any kind of power or majesty. Whatever the faults of Milius' original Conan film, and there are many, at the very least he attempted to get the dark atmosphere of Howard's world right and to convey some fraction of the characters' fatalism. Unless the new \"Solomon Kane\" film is a huge surprise, it will be the only example of somebody even attempting something different of this type in a fantasy movie for a long time.\n",
      "My Dear. What has happened here. I am one of the greatest fans of Sword & Sorcery films ever (I can enjoy almost all of them). I have seen all the sword and sorcery films I can. I even liked Wizards of the Lost Kingdom! ALOT! But this movie was a complete waste of my time. I bought it for $2.00 at a local video sale and after watching I felt ripped off (and went out and sold it) The main reason for me getting it was that the script was by Charles Edward Pogue, a man who I have alot of respect for after \"The Fly\" and \"Psycho 3\" But I could'nt see a trace of his usual good work here. Was it producer interference??? I wont bother with the plot or the acting or lighting and direction except to say that they are all terrible. This feels like a movie done by a bad commercials director (e.g No understanding of narrative or character). But I guess what I find most objectionable about this film is that there was no entertainment value or originality whatsoever. Even in some of the very worst films there can be weird or inventive or hilarious sequences just due to experimentation. But there was nothing here. Im sorry to be so critical but really please avoid.\n",
      "This is a text book example of how not to do a fantasy movie. Sorbo is wasted..and its a sad comment that the writing for his hit show Hercules is 20 times better than this dreck. From the cheesey rock music sound track at the opening credits you realize they are not going to give the genre any respect..and great movies like Army of Darkness..can make fun of the genre while still respecting it.<br /><br />Kull is nearly devoid of any intentional humor. Though you will find yourself laughing out loud at various points due to the incredibly lame dialogue and ridiculous performances. I think this is also a film that clearly had no art direction and it offends the chronological senses even worse than Hercules and Xena to the point at which you began to think the entire thing took place in a world of cheesey movie sets instead of some time in our distant past.<br /><br />No effort is made to build any characters or make us care about anyone..and no one is likeable or cool enough to care about them at first sight.<br /><br />I'm not even sure this would be good WITH the MST3K crew riffing on it. When its not being stupid ..it just drags.\n",
      "I saw this movie twice, and both times I just sat there and wondered why they even put this movie in to production. It's totally a brute force type movie with tiny bits of emotion, and Kevin Sorbo is not a great actor, he's just strong and has a good voice. Tia Carrere (who is Miss I-have-no-career-since-I-am-no-longer-in-Wayne's_World) does not give a very good performance either, and is not good for a mean bitchy character. The movie is so typical of most action movies these days, and the only thing that sets it apart from those is that it is set back in time. Kull the Conqueror is a wannabe movie of Hercules. I'm guessing they didn't have the rights to make a Hercules movie, so they took the same premise of sorts (big strong guy kicks the crap outta bad guys in medieval times) and made this awful movie. I just laughed at it's mediocrity. The lines are so typical, and so are the fights. I give this movie a 4, only because the special effects weren't too bad.\n",
      "I just watched this movie on Movie Time and not even Kevin Sorbo could keep me watching this waste of film. All this movie is is a lot of testosterone mixed with pretty women. Jesus if I wanted to watch a pretty boy killing people off I'd watch The Legend of Hercules not this atrocity. <br /><br />Please ladies if you see this movie in the stores RUN. RUN hard, RUN long, and RUN fast because I wasted about 10 minutes of my otherwise active life watching this movie and I feel like it was a really big waste of 10 minutes of my life and 3.5 hours of their film.<br /><br />It was really stupid and machismo stuff aimed at 15 year old boys and if I had a 15 year old boy I certainly wouldn't let him watch this.\n",
      "i wasn't too impressed with this movie.it is in the style of both the Conan movies,but i didn't like it anywhere near as much.there was lots of action,but i still found it to be slow and boring.it becomes a bit more interesting from the halfway point on,but barely.i didn't find the acting very good,although Kevin Sorbo was good as the title character.but it was Tia Carrere who i thought was very impressive as the evil Queen.however,the only real reason i stuck it out was i noticed that the beginning credits listed Harvey Fierstein in the movie.he doesn't show up until about halfway through,but i liked him in his role.otherwise,the movie is tedious and very hard to get through.for me,Kull the Conqueror is a 4/10.\n",
      "In the very beginning of the movie, Kull (Hercules) is attempting to join an army, but fails. This is odd, because he seems to be a foreigner since he seems to know nothing of the local culture. Therefore, why would he try to join an army of a country he's never heard of? The King has gone mad and is killing all his sons, and Kull stops him by killing him. The army I already mentioned were all made up of men of royal blood (I.e. the King's relatives) so, since all the Kings direct heirs are dead, there is some confusion as to which one of the soldiers is the rightful heir. It's most likely one of two of the soldiers, and of course they themselves are somewhat bias as to which one it is. However, the King, with his dying breath, decrees that Kull is the next King.<br /><br />And that's the first three minutes of the movie. (Or might have even been the first MINUTE).<br /><br />This is basically a low-budget sword-and-sorcery movie. The culture isn't established enough, Nothing's really explained about Kull's motives other than liking axes and not liking slavery, and basically the whole movie is alright but not great. See this movie if you just wanna see some low-budget sword-and-sorcery, or if you like to watch movies for the purpose of laughing at them. If you like GOOD movies, I suggest Lord of the Rings.\n",
      "Viewed 28.3.05.<br /><br />I know nothing of the literary provenance of this movie, Sword n Sorcery not being my thing. But I do have the necessary ability to switch off reality and overlook the silliness of all the made-up names and fake mythology. This particular foray seemed glossy, glamorous and to promise much.<br /><br />Especially when the wizard shows us the cave full of ancient mummies of dead demons that one imagines are going to come back to life later on. For a starter he resurrects the boss-witch who passes through some great metamorphoses before wisely settling on the form of Tia Carrera. as ever, ineffably gorgeous dominatrix diva. Alas, she didn't get to torment men much and that orange hair-do was a total distraction.<br /><br />Lot of scrapping, well choreographed but not my cup of tea, passing by way of an ice-God's magic breath to a fiery showdown. Then I realise, where are the demons? Mashabasha or whatever her name was had kept harpy-ing on about her Hellish court on Earth but she just didn't deliver. a pity, because the static mummy-dummies in the cave looked very promising.<br /><br />There is one ape-man-thing in a very minor role. Not even a villain, so much as an incidental character.<br /><br />Maybe they mis-spent the special effects budget putting demons off the carte.<br /><br />Is \"Kull\" meant to sound like \"Cull\", as in, killing surplus livestock?\n",
      "Well, I didn't really expect much from this film but I found myself watching it all the way through. The whole feel of the film is a culmination of a typical Conan rip-off and the Hercules TV series that Kevin Sorbo starred in, and as much as he tries old Kev will always be Hercules. Though I have to say, there are a few features to this film that rescue it to just above watchable. Number one being the soundtrack, not only is there the typical orchestral score behind every dramatic scene and/or plot revelation but we are actually treated to some rock music during the occasional fight scenes. Now, being a man who believes that the soundtrack is integral to any great movie (Come on, you all remember the theme/soundtrack to all your favourite films) I felt uplifted to hear some heavy guitar music over the fights. What a great idea, it works well and I wish we'd hear more of it in bigger Hollywood productions. But on to the rest of the film. Performances - average to just above average. A little disappointed with Tia Carrere but to be honest I doubt there was much more she could have done in the role. Maybe someone else would have been better for the job. Everyone else was OK except for Thomas Ian Griffith who absolutely blew me away. To start I was kind of annoyed with his character but as he got more and more evil I found his time on screen to be entertaining. His lines and performance were delivered perfectly, best performance in the film. There were some OK-to-low scale special effects in this but nothing that can't be forgiven on something of this calibre. Most of the fight scenes I found to be very entertaining making you follow each swing of the blade/axe, and they were carried through the film by the rock music I mentioned earlier. Better fights that I expected. Lastly but not least, even for a fantasy film the costumes were just bizarre and I think I should leave it there. The less said about them the better.<br /><br />Overall, a surprisingly entertaining movie but I wouldn't recommend you to go out and buy it unless you are a fantasy junkie or really enjoy seeing Kevin Sorbo on screen a lot.\n",
      "Why!!! It has to be illegal to do this with one of Robert E. Howards characters. This movie is totally crappy. It's even too bad to laugh at. Do not see this movie.\n",
      "I never had such a good time making fun of a movie until this feature-length Hercules episode came along. Everything seemed to have been fished from the bottom drawer: lame flaming swords (gosh, could those be their attempts at light-sabres?), scrap-metal artifacts, second-rate hell-beasts, and an ensemble of clowns. All thrown in with that wannabe fantasy-epic intro. My friend and I were left with eyes watering and bellies aching from almost non-stop laughter. One of those flicks which are so bad they're actually good.\n",
      "As an avid fan of fantasy and adventure, I had extremely high hopes for Kull. I went in, with the thoughts of Willow (Arguably the best fantasy film ever made), and discovered two things. One, the theatre charged way too much for crappy movies and two, the movie's horrible. Kevin Sorbo plays Kull of Atlantis who joins a noble army and ends being King and also ends up being part of an intricate plot to revive some ancient demoness. I read somewhere that Kull, before its release, was edited countless times from a new director. Well that basically destoys the movie. There were more holes in the plot then there are in the Moon and none of the characters really develops in the movie. Tia plays an unconvincing villain, with little depth, and with cliche lines. The rest of the cast just drags along with the boring and overused plot. The only redeeming quality of the film are its sets. Otherwise I would give it a 1. The movie more than deserves my 3 rating.\n",
      "*minor spoilers*<br /><br />This movie is heinous beyond words and expression. Sure, no one is expecting Citizen Kane, or maybe even another Conan, but this is supposed to be entertaining with swords and magic. We have plenty of cartoon characters running at each other with swords, but absolutely zero entertainment to speak of. The dialogue is atrocious and hilarious together. When it tries to be serious, forcing cartoons like Sorbo and Tia to act, it becomes comical and humorous. This is actually good fodder for MST3K. Too bad they don't exist anymore.<br /><br />The story was basically written by a group of kindergarten kids. Big evil person wants to takeover the world. Enter reluctant hero who happens to dig heavy metal and rock. That pretty much sums up Kull the Conqueror, heh.<br /><br />If you really want to laugh with your friends, by all means watch this.<br /><br />1/10\n",
      "I had SO much hope and hype over this film. Watching it finally nearly drove me to suicide. What in the name of the planets is this? I thought they were playing some kind of 80 minutes episode of a parody of Hercules. The plot of the film is absurd. Some unknown barbarian who hails from Atlantis (yes, Atlantis of all places) tries to join a noblemen's army, gets rejected and humiliated, and ends up being their King because the dying King thinks its comical that a barbarian should take a crack at it? We get to see the real Kull now after he gets the crown. The typical and oh so unoriginal hero who has no flaws, treats women with respect, thinks there should be no slavery and he makes it a point, and gives an occassional grunt to remind he is after all under all that heroic visage, a barbarian. Gimmie a break. The dialogue is hilarious when the movie builds. Some good moments when Herc.. I mean Kull insists there is no Island of whatever the frozen wastelands is and Ascalante with a quick retort, \"yes there is!\" Or, the excitement and the adrenaline building up in your body watching Kull clumsily trying to escape from the guards and mouthing the infamous word, \"S**t.\" Needless to say, when any of the characters begins to talk, it kills them right there.\n",
      "This movie plays like a 90 minute TV show. You know the kind of TV I'm talking about. Crap stuff that plays on cable trying to cash in on old themes, crap like the Conan and Robin Hood series, and yes Hercules and Xena. The acting is crap and the characters all act and talk like modern day Americans, thanks not only to the writing but the TV quality actors. The problem with stuff like this is it makes no real effort to transport you to another time and place, because costume and set design alone doesn't work. Instead it's just a bunch of everyday modern Americans playing dress up. You could have the biggest budget in the world and the greatest attention to background detail, but having a main character who's basically a walking anachronism will make it all null.<br /><br />If this was actually the script for the third Conan film, it's easy to see why Arnie said no. The story is dreadful. Everything about the film is dreadful. I really hate the theme of \"setting things right\" in ancient times. Their beliefs and their laws suited the people of the time. It's so bigoted (and American) to say \"this is how you ought to be\". This film is so formulaic and stupid that I couldn't help but laugh at every predictable \"plot\" development and piece of dialogue.<br /><br />The biggest \"star\" in it, aside from Sorbo who's career has basically died since, is Tia Carerre playing a really stupid but typical female villain. Come to think of it, she doesn't have much of a career anymore either.<br /><br />Gah. There's nothing to redeem this film at all. It even has ROCK MUSIC during one of the battle sequences. It's even worse than Christopher Lambert's Beowulf.<br /><br />2/10\n",
      "Perhaps people who are fans of the Hercules/Xena/Queen of Swords line of TV shows will be able to sit through this. I only did to see if there was any way the movie would redeem itself. It didn't.<br /><br />My first complaint is simply that the screenwriters/director/producer seem to think they are better storytellers than R.E. Howard - they aren't. Howard was a legend from the pulp era, and any of his characters and settings can stand alone without modern tinkering for plot.<br /><br />My second complaint is in the dialogue and the execution of the dialogue. No one involved in making this movie seems to have heard of having their actors deliver their lines with any sort of cadence. They all sound like bored airline ticket agents. The characters also all speak in a modern dialect, with contractions and words that would have no place in 20,000 BC. Even the opening voice-over is lousy. In this they follow in the footsteps of the TV shows, which also take bad teen melodrama dialogue into the sword and sorcery genre.\n",
      "Where on earth did Kevin Sorbo come from? He's better in Andromeda, but not much. Why, why would anyone cast him in any heroic role? He's nasally, dull and has a Midwestern accent absolutely identical in everything he does. And that can NOT be his real body - which would at least explain why he can't act. He's at Gold's gym night and day. Tia Carrere, however, is so beautiful, and so understated as the seductress - really, it's almost worth the agony just to see her in her pale blue gown. Anyhow, for god's sake don't rent this. I'm just stuck with it on the Sci-fi channel. Battlestar Galactica, here I come! I'm not even sure I can get 10 lines out talking about this. Have I made it yet?\n",
      "whoever cast Harvey Fierstein as a baddie/action figure was either bribed or blackmailed. What were they thinking of? This is a pitiful excuses for a film, it makes Red Sonja look good. A terrible script, embarrassing stunts and a cast to cringe for... and a no-money for special effects either. <br /><br />I can see where the Conan rewrite comes in. And i can see why Arnie declined it. Maybe it was written by someone's 14 year old after one too many games of D&D. Beware girl magic users in ridiculously skimpy clothes, a celibate monk and our all shouting, all hamming, fighter-barbarian<br /><br />FRom a political point of the view, the 'woman as a passive vessel for the breath of god' is dodgy as hell<br /><br />Conquerer DeathMatch result: Conan 5 Kull 0\n",
      "This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen, for poor acting and unbelievable plot. A lot of the acting is like watching a bad TV show, and gets extremely hokey at times. The film starts out OK and gets progressively worse, with the climax being the last scene in the movie. It might be a good movie to watch if you were extremely intoxicated for sheer comedy value (although the movie isn't supposed to be comedy).\n",
      "I glanced at other reviews, and I have to wonder...did I miss something? This seems like an interesting enough premise but the execution left something to be desired, in my mind. A female police officer (Sarah-Jane Redmond) is drawn into a situation by a drug dealer who has come to the station with stories of being kidnapped (with a few other men) and submitted to some \"game playing\" for their lives, but he managed to escape, although others were not that lucky. There's also something at the beginning of the film about a monk who documented the story of a nun possessed by what seems to be a fallen angel, back in the 1600's...more about that it a minute. After Porhowski (Redmond) is asked to get her interviewee some water, she returns to find him gone, and by then he's been ID'd as an ex-con who did time for drug trafficking, so they of course, want to find him. And Porhowski does find him, in her car, and he's taking her back to the parking garage where his ordeal took place because she must die in his place (the price for his being set free). Now, that all sounds fairly decent, but here's a few things that didn't work for me. The games that these men are being forced to play to win their survival: I was thinking, like, oh, Russian Roulette, stuff like that, NOT musical chairs & bingo. Oh, and 5-card stud. And a fallen angel taking up residence in a parking garage to dole out justice...uh, right. And this is supposedly the very same fallen angel that appeared at a convent back in the 1600's, and whose history you see a monk busily scribbling in black & white flashbacks (since apparently they didn't have color film in the 1600's?) The overall atmosphere of the film isn't bad, but there seems to be a lot of gaping holes & the overall story is rather confusing and vague. Had some decent potential but did not live up to it. 3 out of 10.\n",
      "this movie was technically made well... in terms of quality of picture and audio... the lighting in some scenes could have taken more thought and effort however on to the story...<br /><br />it pretty much portrays the theme of saw where people are being punished for sins they committed in the past... most of it takes place in a parking lot where the people come across supernatural/horror creatures to finish them off...<br /><br />the dialogue got a bit annoying in some places and they never seem to execute the suspense very well... all in all.. a fair effort... writing and directing doesn't always work for everyone...\n",
      "Oh man.....I just read someone's positive review of this abomination, and I'm not the least bit surprised it came from Canada. (where the film was made) No doubt still laughing their way to the bank because suckers like me rent this drivel. This film blackens radiation level buttons. I have no doubt that if you turned on the Beatles White Album, drank a bottle of wine, put this movie on, and then did a crossword puzzle or something, this film could be entertaining. What is anyone's name in this movie? Detective Porhowski? Why should we care or identify with this woman if we don't know her name? No character development means I am actually rooting for her to get vacuumed up by the crazy demon...or the invisible tooth lady that snuggles people to death. Man, was this bad.... What is the damn deal with the parking garage...of death? I will give slight props to the janitor/parking lot guy, his acting is a clinic on acting from the eyebrows you cannot miss!! But what the hell were these people thinking? The most interesting part of the story is the historical link with the nun's exorcism that we see in the beginning, then is ignored, save one line in the middle, until the post-climax 25 minutes of sloppy wrap-up with a character and her dad that we don't give a crap about anyway....Bottom line, SAVE YOURSELF....RUN FROM THIS MOVIE!!!\n",
      "Priests, demon-possessed nuns, rape, pedophilia - these are the makings of a good horror film when you add demons and the devil. Will this live up to the promise? Sometimes the concept is good, and certainly Sarah-Jane Redmond and Michael Eklund were good, but the story just didn't go anywhere.<br /><br />There was very little action; mostly just running around and talking. Some characters, like the cops in the precinct seemed to be doing work that was just to explain what was happening, as if they had no other way of doing so.<br /><br />The ending was left up to the viewer and that sucked.<br /><br />No gore, no blood, some puking from a strung out doper, and no boobage whatsoever. I really must have blinked once because I didn't see the nun either.\n",
      "Detective Porhowski (Sarah-Jane Redmond) is trying to find out what's happening in her town. Ryan James (Michael Eklund) says he was in a nightmarish place where some supernatural evil was killing people based on sins they've committed. As she delves deeper into this crazy story, the more she realizes that it might not be as crazy as she once thought it was.<br /><br />Supposedly this was based on a true story due to some priests' notes or something like that. Basically it's their way of saying, 'this could possibly happen, so we'll say it did happen and make people believe it happened, even though it never really did happen.' Yea, they tried to manipulate the general audience, to little avail.\n",
      "The beginning scenes of \"The Entrance\" had me optimistic that the film was heading in an unique and frightening direction. Talk about a teasing let down! The flick opens with a terrified man (Michael Eklund, an Ethan Hawk look alike) fleeing from a demon in a deserted parking garage. He escapes and the next thing we know he's yacking with the cops unraveling some ado about being kidnapped and taken to a dark room where he and others sharing his plight are forced to play games. The losers of these games are subjected to 8mm black and white memories of egregious sins they have committed. Then, one by one, each is violently vanquished from the company of the others. The cop conducting the interrogation (Sarah-Jane Redmond) doesn't buy into it. Once she leaves the room to grab him a drink of water he vanishes. She calls it a night and takes off in her car only to get accosted by the guy at knife point who then demands she drive him back to the parking garage claiming, \"They took something from me and you are going to help me get it back!\" Excited to check this one out? Don't be, 'cuz the film goes absolutely nowhere ending abruptly at 80 minutes in length and useless. Throughout the tale, some attempt at drawing a correlation between the above and the exorcism of a 17th century nun fails to explain itself and what we are left with is a \"WTF-There's an hour and twenty minutes of my life I will never get back!\" Seriously, the film had tremendous potential and some unnerving visuals. I suspect finances fell short and creativity was sacrificed for a deadline. Disappointing.\n",
      "I'm a big Jimeoin fan. Huge. But I think i've realised I only like his stand-up work. His first movie \"The Craic\" was terrible, and this may be worse. I don't understand how he wrote this, the same guy who writes his stand-up routine, yet the movie is so poor. I didn't laugh once. I went \"ha\" in one scene. Bob Franklin, Colin Lane and Shaun Micallef were totally wasted.<br /><br />The movie is about a movie extra who wants to get a starring role so he can become a big star, become famous and become important. Problem is is that he's a terrible actor and has lots of bad luck. Does he realise his dream? I'd say \"you have to see the movie\" but I don't want you to get mad at me for wasting a couple of bucks hiring the DVD.<br /><br />I admire him for giving the comedy movie a go, history shows Aussie's have been terrible at making comedies (\"The Castle\" is excused), but maybe stick to the gags Jimeoin.<br /><br />(I gave the movie a 1 for the fact it was shot in Melbourne and had some good shots)\n",
      "Jimeoin is a nameless actor who finds himself as the eternal extra",
      " never to play a principle role in a movie. He finds himself caught up with a group of would-be stars all trying to gain a break but none of them are able to do so.<br /><br />I was ready for a good comedy, but was bitterly disappointed. Jimeoin is a great comedian but this smacked of 'try hard' and it just failed. There were a few moments where I laughed out aloud and I recognised several moments of clever humour, but it wasn't enough. I enjoyed spotting the good familiar Aussie actors and scenes around Melbourne. I think you should spend your money seeing something else...\n",
      "The Extra is about a man seeking fame through acting. He wants to be an actor but can only secure roles as extras. He wants to dine with the ladies and get attention. Jimeoin is 'The Extra' as his name isn't mentioned throughout the whole movie. I understand the quote on all the billboards and things now... 'No one knew his name, they still don't'. The storyline isn't that great. It wasn't as interesting as I expected, especially with all the top notch Australian actors. (Rhys Muldoon, Shaun Micallef, Bob Franklin) I was hoping for a little more humour as it's called a 'Romantic/Comedy'. I think I only laughed about 2 times; when he kicks a door and it hits back into him, and Russell Gilbert, the cameraman and his crossed eyes. Last year I went to the filming of 'The Extra', as an extra, and I was excited to see the film. But honestly I thought it was a waste of time and money because it just got boring! Jimeoin's a funny man, I was expecting a lot more humour and it's not what I got. He was the writer of the story and I'll say that his ability to write movies isn't that crash-hot. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this as a good film to watch.\n",
      "Bad Acting. Bad Writing. Bad Directing. This film was so bad even the popcorn sucked! The only thing believable about the story was that a guy with the acting abilities of the star, Jimeoin, couldn't even get work as an Extra. Seems a little too real to me. By the way, Jimeoin played his part really well- that part being a bloke that can't act for shite. The pace of the film was similar to the 19 hour Holocoaust documentary, Shoah, just not as funny. They're four credited writers on this film- which means somehow that they're four people on this planet who actually wanted to take credit for this insult to celluloid.. I suppose there will be new agents and managers for all involved here. I kind of get the idea that perhaps the whole film was just some tax scheme for some crafty investors who needed to take a loss- kind of like \"Springtime for Hitler\" in \"The Producers\". Things certainly don't look promising for Australian Cinema.\n",
      "Never before have I seen assembled into one movie so many humongously breasted women. Remarkable! I gather the movie's more about the breasts than anything else, which is fine. It was a little confusing figuring out who was who in the beginning because the robots all looked pretty similar (cheesy robot masks with moving jaws almost carelessly placed atop suits and ties that are hanging on coat hangers). Also, the editing was pretty choppy and the blood and gore were filmed at a separate time from the murder scene and were on a completely limited budget, so it kinda' looked like a buxom woman looking towards the camera and screaming (about 50 times), then a quick cut to some scene in a butcher shop. This disconnect made the movie seem not very gory, even though I guess if you bought what they were selling, it was pretty gory.<br /><br />Props for the writer/director for actually adhering to a plot throughout. Some of the dialog and accents were a little contrived, hokey and derivative, but were also vaguely amusing at times.<br /><br />If you're a man who likes big breasts and are gonna have a couple like-minded buddies over for some beers, this could be a good one to watch.\n",
      "If you have read the book by David Baldacci then I highly suggest that you DO NOT watch this movie!!!! The book was absolutely marvelous and intriguing and I have read it twice. Unfortunately, I watched the movie afterwords and was incredibly disappointed. It seems that Clint Eastwood has to always be the number one in all of his movies. To do that they have totally written out the main character of the book! (In fact, Eastwood's character died halfway through the novel.) This is one of the worst book to movies that I have ever seen! My sister, who watched the movie then read the book also expressed displeasure at the plot changes in the movie. I admit that if you haven't read the book you may enjoy the movie only because you don't know how good it could have been.\n",
      "Over the years, I've come to expect more and more of Clint Eastwood's directoral efforts, and I've never been disappointed, until now. A stellar cast is wasted in this mess of a thriller.<br /><br />It's been said before, but it bears repeating: If you want to send a message, call Western Union.\n",
      "From incredibly inept scriptwriting to ridiculously bad acting, sloppy editing and incompetent directing, this film belongs in movie-dumb's rubbish bin. It starts out slowly, with no dialog, then increases its yawn factor as words are added to this meandering, nonsensical script. There are so many disconnected and incomplete avenues in this film that the viewer suspects it is a parody of a real movie. It continues trudging along into an undeveloped storyline that makes the viewer wonder if anyone actually viewed this film before it was released onto an unsuspecting public. Hard to believe Clint Eastwood directed, produced and acted in this piece of human excrement. This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen.\n",
      "Very slow paced and extremely unlikely development. Nothing to make you give a hoot about the main character in the first place. It gets worse and worse. It was so bad that my husband and I could hardly believe it at times. We joked about it for months afterwards. I can't think of a worse movie ever made!\n",
      "Excuse me for asking, but ask I will: Are we supposed to believe that a senior citizen is able to neatly sneak into a heavily protected house, break into the owner's sanctum-sanctorum, and then witness the President of the United States having a fist fight with a woman, who is then assassinated by government employees? Are we REALLY supposed to believe that? Isn't that stretching things a bit too far - even for a movie? And then after, we're supposed to believe that the thief is really a good guy who really cares? And that he's merely a retiree who happens to steal things - but has a sense of integrity? Or that the President of the United States is screwing his benefactors wife - in the benefactor's home? C'mon now ... this can't be a serious drama. Maybe it was meant to be a science fiction story about a retiree with some kind of special power to perform acts of magic that defy any sense of logic, because this movie defies logic.\n",
      "So Young So Bad is a juvenile version of Caged with the female prisoners being of the teenage variety. In fact the it's obvious to me that this film was absolutely an attempt to cash in on the popularity and notoriety of MGM's female classic.<br /><br />It's not an all female cast though. Paul Henreid plays a new prison psychologist who with Catherine McLeod is shocked at the sadistic treatment meted out by the head of the institution, Cecil Clovelly and the head guard Grace Coppin who is a slimmed down and toned down version of Hope Emerson.<br /><br />The most fascinating aspect of this film is the fact that of the four girls who are the focus of the plot, three of them went on to have some pretty substantial careers. The four are Anne Francis, Rita Moreno, Anne Jackson, and Enid Pulver. <br /><br />Anne Francis made her film debut in this and she's the sexpot of the group. She's an unwed mother who has her cap now set for Paul Henreid and I'm not quite sure how he was able to resist the temptation. You could tell this woman had a future in Hollywood.<br /><br />But the best performance in this film is that of Rita Moreno. She plays a mentally disturbed teen who is the special object of cruelty by Coppin with tragic results.<br /><br />Though So Young So Bad is a trashy film, it's interesting to see how many stars came out of it. Or in spite of it.\n",
      "An idealistic doctor, Paul Henreid, is a counselor or something at a new prison for naughty young girls. No walls, but humane treatment -- that sort of thing. The fly in the ointment is the headmistress or foreman or whatever she is, the top sergeant, who runs the place on a day-to-day basis. And what an old-fashioned meanie she is, groomed like Mrs. Danvers or maybe the wife in \"American Gothic\".<br /><br />This movie was one of a spate that came out in the post-war years dealing with one or another social problem, often, as here, penology. Among the others were \"The Snake Pit,\" \"Sniper,\" \"Gentleman's Agreement,\" \"Crossfire,\" others whose titles don't come to mind at the moment. This is a lesser example of the genre, but not entirely without interest.<br /><br />What makes it interesting is that, though Paul Henreid, Ingrid Bergman's husband in \"Casablanca\" seven years earlier, was by now over the hill and reduced to B pictures, the movie is full of those naughty young girls, including the 18-year-old Rita Moreno and the 19-year-old Ann Francis. They run around in their skivvies, get into fights, talk nasty, are cynical about everything, trying to run away -- in other words, these luscious young beauties are just begging to be spanked. That's all they really need. They don't need an understanding headmaster, just a couple of whacks. Oh, not savage whacks. Not at all. Rather, deeply caring whacks, whacks of love, so to speak, not enough to hurt but just enough to warm. Why didn't Paul Henreid try that instead of this antiquated humanism? Huh? I'll bet he WANTED to turn Ann Francis over his knee, that lanky and insinuating blond vixen, and teach her a lesson. You can see it in his face. The gentle smile can't mask the lascivious grin of the maniac underneath. Come to think of it, if that didn't work, why he could just have THEM spank HIM. They'd be learning a trade too -- professional dominatrix. <br /><br />Anyway, if he didn't, he must be as crazy as the rest of this unimaginative movie. Some of the shots are striking; in others the lighting alone could have been handled by an alert ten-year-old kid. But why go on?<br /><br />This movie is \"reformist\" in the same way that Cecil B. DeMille's early movies showed a lot of nudity, just to make sure we knew how sinful nudity was; or in the same way as one of those anti-war pictures that show us the brutality of combat before we inevitably win the battle. What hypocrisy.\n",
      "This film is hilarious. Not only does it have the completely bizarre factor of a dog barking at black bears, cougars and birds and then legging it, but one of the funniest scenes I have ever seen. I was literally crying.<br /><br />Some of the more passionate Benji fans on this page will recall immediately the heart-stopping scene where our hero, Benji, is being chased by the terrifying wolf. Thankfully, the wolf meets his demise by tossing himself off a cliff, and then falling stiff as a board down into the canyon below as if the production crew had thrown a stuffed wolf out of a plane. On the way down the wolf goes... awoooooooooooooooooooooooooooo....\n",
      "If this movie was meant to be anything but a farce, it failed miserably.<br /><br />If it WAS meant to be a farce, it was a very poor quality, and a not funny farce.<br /><br />Internal logic is lacking. Events happen without any indication of how the characters arrived at conclusions/decisions/actions.<br /><br />Genres & sequence:<br /><br />- Starting with a Road Warrior type of sequence in 2025.<br /><br />- Character time travels to 1986, then promptly dies after telling a local young couple that a spear head he brought is special (it had pierced the body of the once called \"Christ\").<br /><br />- Couple is inexplicably chased by Nazis who somehow know that the spearhead is in their possession.<br /><br />- Couple travel to Hong Kong in search of a \"professor\".<br /><br />- Couple and Kung-Fu taxi driver encounter and fight a Kung-Fu Master who doesn't like their visiting the \"Silver Fox Pagoda\".<br /><br />- Couple find \"professor\" who is captured by Nazis, and professor dies while couple miraculously escapes the Nazis twice.<br /><br />- Everyone ends up on a \"small\" island off the coast of Hong Kong.<br /><br />- Small island off the coast of Hong Kong is inhabited by lost tribes of: Mogols, Little People, and Amazon Women.

      "I will only say a few words about this almost forgotten sleaze classic from 1970. At the time, it represented some kind of point of no return for bad taste movies, and could still hold its own today. The most memorable viewing I ever had with this marathon of perversity, loosely based on the exploits of Thirties bank robbers the Barker-Karpis gang, was at a college film society in the early Seventies. The movie was so depressing and grim on the one hand, and so ludicrously , deliriously over the top on the other, that by the end, the audience was either numb from all the slaughter and cruelty, or laughing uproariously at things we knew weren't really funny. A couple of sequences near the end made the biggest impression. An old black man at a Florida tourist camp greets the newly arrived gangsters, and tells them about a legendary alligator named Old Joe, that haunts the creeks and lakes nearby. Later, Bruce Dern as his usual manic character ,and another gang member steal a pig, and trail it along behind a boat, hoping to lure Old Joe out of hiding. Meanwhile, sad, dreamy, drug addict son Robert DeNiro dies of a fatal heroin overdose on the riverbank, grieving over his lost love, who Ma had ordered killed. Suddenly, an alligator head appears menacingly in the water behind the boat, and the trigger happy mobsters gleefully blast Old Joe with machine guns. Meanwhile, Ma finds the body of her son on the river bank ,and goes completely wacko, shrieking and keening over her loss, which leads to one of the most unintentionally funny lines I have ever heard. As Ma wails and mourns with some of her other sons, the two guys in the boat proudly announce that they've bagged Old Joe, and Shelley Winters shrieks back at them, \" How can you care about that? Your brother's dead, and you're out there playin' with gators!\" This brought down the house at the screening I attended, followed moments later by the tearful Scatman Crothers phoning the sheriff to tell about the crazy folks and what they done. Weeping into the phone, the old black man asks rhetorically, \" What they done? I'll tell ya what they done: they stole ma pig, and then they went and killed Old Joe!\" Once again, this tragic moment caused total hilarity in the audience. This movie almost defies analysis. I cannot recommend it, unless you're a die-hard fan of Roger Corman or Shelley Winters. It is truly unforgettable, which is not a good thing, in this case.\n",
      "I watched BLOODY MAMA because I love Shelley Winters and wanted to see where Robert De Niro started as an actor. Well, it wasn't worth watching. What started interestingly enough quickly became tiresome and unwatchable. The script is a complete mess. Really. I never seen such a badly written story for a film ever. It just doesn't know what to do with its characters. By the time the film focused on the kidnapped man who was bound to a chair, I lost interest. What the hell were they thinking?<br /><br />Poor Shelley, stuck in this bad movie. Whenever she's one screen, her mere presence elevates this movie up a couple of extra stars. Remove her completely and no one, and I mean no one would remember this film. Aside from the scene when Shelley robs a bank and forces old ladies to hang on to their car and the subsequent car chase, seeing the old ladies hang for dear life, which I admit was really fun, this film is totally forgettable.\n",
      "This is an incredibly tasteless tale that is reputed to be the story of the notorious Ma Barker and her demented criminal sons. Unfortunately, most of what you see in this Roger Corman production is pure hooey--with no basis in the real lives of this criminal family. The biggest problem with the story is that Ma is shown as the brains and motivating force behind the Barker gang, though most histories of the gangster era of the late 20s and early 30s completely contradict this. In addition to playing fast and loose with this, many other details of the film are pure fabrication, so if you are looking for a biography, don't bother.<br /><br />However, if you are looking for a very guilty pleasure--sort of like \"The Jerry Springer Show\" combined with the Barker story, then this is for you! The story you'll see if almost completely depraved and rather shocking even today, as prison sodomy, senseless murders, drug abuse, rape and the most psychologically twisted semi-incestuous family on film is what you'll see. Now this might be really hard to take, but having the actors (particularly Shelly Winters) overact so severely actually made most of it seem rather funny instead of realistic. Still, given these topics, nudity and a lot of blood, it's certainly not for children or the squeamish. Entertaining but pure trash.\n",
      "There are disturbing elements to the film. Mainly, that the gang kill and rape indiscriminately, just because they can and depending on their mood at the time. Which makes this film slightly uncomfortable as it is based on a true story. Although how much of the film is true I'm not sure. But the film does come across as a cross between Bonnie & Clyde and the first half of A Clockwork Orange. <br /><br />I watched this film, for probably the same reason that most people watch it today. Because it contains an early performance by De Niro. And although he is the best thing in it, that isn't saying much. He doesn't really give any indication of the big star or acting guru he was only a few years away from becoming.<br /><br />But that isn't really his fault. What lets this film down the most is not the acting, but the script. None of the characters are developed at any point to become interesting, or for you to care what does or does not happen to them.<br /><br />Nor do we have any empathy for most of the victims. One is so particularly stupid I found myself wanting them to get their sticky end. The army of G-Men chasing them are not developed, so there is no antagonist for the gang. The gang themselves get on pretty well with each other so there's no drama there.<br /><br />This film really was a wasted opportunity and by the end of it you really couldn't care less.\n",
      "Silly psychological drama about Ma Barker and her sons who robbed and killed in the 1920s. Roger Corman directed this...it seems like he was actually trying to do a serious movie...sadly, it doesn't work at all. This movie has a following but damned if I know why.<br /><br />It is very well-acted but the script and direction ramble all over the place. Also I found most of the actors dialogue unintelligible -- they're all putting on stupid Southern accents which don't help. Also, the movie is VERY sleazy. Rape, murder, incest, torture, beatings, drug abuse, homosexuality (portrayed negatively unfortunately)...you name it. I'm no prude, but this movie rubs your face in it. For instance, the opening scene has a young girl (about 13) being held down by her brothers while her father rapes her!<br /><br />This is ALMOST worth seeing to see Shelley Winters chewing the scenery as Ma and Robert DeNiro before he hit it big.<br /><br />All in all, a must miss.\n",
      "This is supposed to be sort of a true story. Shelley Winters stars as Ma Barker who, with her perverted, animalistic and sadistic sons, goes around the country robbing, raping and killing. There is decent acting in the flick, but only by a very young Robert DeNiro. Shelley Winters never was much as an actress. Bruce Dern is pretty decent in his role as well, but he seems to excel in bizarre character roles. There is plenty of totally senseless violence, and these people are depicted as just totally evil. At no point in the film can you feel anything resembling pity for this bunch. All in all, this is a poorly made low budget film and pretty much not worth your time. I gave it 2 out of 10 since they throw out votes of 1.\n",
      "This is the sort of movie where a character's behavior is best explained by saying \"the plot requires it.\" A Warner Brothers entry at the height of the film-noir era, \"Nora Prentiss\" was a box-office success and a boost for Ann Sheridan's career. Today, however, it looks like a parody of its own genre. The main problem is the script, which director Vincent Sherman and others adapted from a short story by Paul Webster. The unlikely tale proceeds through a series of melodramatic twists and turns involving a married San Francisco physician named Dr. Richard Talbot (Kent Smith) and the title character, a stunning nightclub singer (Sheridan). Melodrama, of course, always under girds film noir, but when audiences watch this kind of movie they want to believeif only for 90 minutesthat the events could really be happening. With this picture, it's a tough job. Making the situation worse is dialog that strains to sound memorable and ends up sounding phony. There are warning signs from the start, with the first five minutes being so heavy with exposition that you want to shout, \"Enough! I get the point!\" Still, there are some good things to be said about \"Nora Prentiss.\" The central plot gimmick is an interesting one, despite its implausibility. James Wong Howe's cinematography effectively captures the story's shadowy moods. And the alluring Sheridan, as usual, gives a solid performance. But the casting of Kent Smith presents problems. During Smith's time with Warners the studio liked to assign him the role of an earnest wimp involved with a captivating woman (see him opposite Joan Crawford in \"The Damned Don't Cry,\" which Sherman directed three years later). So it's easy to see how producers chose this actor to play the conservative doctor. But Smith lacked charisma, and in this film the audience has to keep reminding itself that the vibrant Nora finds the dull Dr. Richard Talbot fascinating. Why does she, anyway? (The plot requires it.) Why does this worldly but essentially decent woman take up with a repressed family man in the first place? (The plot requires it.) And why does Richard veer off into a tangle of unbelievable actions that grow increasingly grotesque as the film rolls toward its disastrous finale? (The plot",
      "well, you get the idea.) For the rest, there are competent performances by Rosemary DeCamp as Richard's wife, by Bruce Bennett as Richard's partner in a medical practice, and by Robert Alda as Nora's nightclub boss and lover-in-waiting. The musical score is by Franz Waxman.\n",
      "(potential spoilers)<br /><br />The theater was filled with people expecting what this picture could have potentially been if given more time to develop the story. Instead the audience got another story filled with quick cutaways and bass designed to give you a scare in that moment, but after leaving you with an emptiness where the story should have filled.<br /><br />I will say this though, this movie didn't suck because of Adrien Brody. He was fun to watch and his subtleties didn't go unnoticed. A part that comes to mind is when he asks Kiera Knightly what year it is, she says 2007 and he gives his unbelieving, \"wha.\" Unfortunately the rest of the scene took place in bizarre 2007. What attractive 20 something female is going to bring to her apartment (where she lives alone) a mysterious Adrien Brody standing outside freezing. Her reason for letting him stay is that she called all the homeless shelters and none are open, so she'd feel guilty if she sent this guy she met 1 min ago away. \"You can sleep on my couch.\" Trusting aren't we. I didn't buy it. Also watching her vast array of facial expressions in this scene also brought a tear to my eye... from laughter. <br /><br />I don't know about you but I'm so sick of films that use static and weird sound effects with shooting images to get the audience on edge. Ever since the Ring I haven't been able to appreciate them anymore and it looks more and more like a cheap thrill device. I was sitting in the theater waiting for those parts to be over. <br /><br />All in all, the Jacket was a decent, unfinished story that had so much more potential. If it wasn't for Brody and a character named Mckenzie, this film would be a lot harder to watch. They tried to do something different, but didn't follow up. <br /><br />4 (for effort) out of 10.\n",
      "An interesting concept with some very cool ideas that never really reaches its potential. Instead of exploring the implications of time traveling, the film sidetracks into a very rushed and hasty romance, one that never really makes sense. The scenes in the mental hospital add nothing new to the stock stereotype, and the ending is telegraphed a mile away. There are a few interesting ideas on time travel that are bandied about, but they ultimately go nowhere, and the military scenes at the beginning seem to serve no purpose for the rest of the movie. The story is flawed, but it's still interesting, the performances are great, and the visuals are kinda cool but nothing outstanding. An interesting concept turned into a decent film.<br /><br />The thing that bothered me most was the entire point of Knightley's character Jackie. At first I just thought she'd be a sign to Jack that he's time traveling, but then she ends up helping him and being the love interest? How'd that happen? There's a rather large leap from her throwing him out of her place to her going out of her way to help him. It felt like there was a scene missing. In fact, all the scenes in the future seemed to ignore continuity and logic altogether. It was a bit disjointed, even for a sci-fi movie.<br /><br />The ideas brought up by this movie on time travel have been discussed much better in other films and works of literature, so the film doesn't add much more to it. The movie's a decent watch, never causing you to lose interest, and the pace is perfect for this kind of film. It just doesn't seem to add up to anything special. It actually could have used a bunch more depth to it, to fill out the characters and inject some emotion and realism into the film. Still, it's an interesting movie, at the very least.\n",
      "I thought this was a bad movie, and its box office totals certainly reflect that. This film wants us to believe that a doctor in a psych ward drugs his patients and then straps a weird jacket on them and puts them in a morgue drawer for a while. And all this allows the patient to time travel in his mind and apparently in reality. The doctor had no idea this would happen? Also, the film never told what type of results the doctor was expecting by putting a patient in a morgue drawer.<br /><br />While in the drawer, it shows many close ups of Jack's eyes, then starts showing flashes of images. And then some how Jack winds up about 15 years in the future. During his first trip, he meets a girl, Jackie, who he remembers from his past. She doesn't know him. But, she picks up this stranger and lets him stay at her place? Not believable. And then later she sleeps with him?<br /><br />Jack gets Jackie to help him investigate his death from 15 years earlier. He thinks it was foul play. Then there is a side plot of him helping one of the other doctors discover what is wrong with a sick child. Why was that part even in there? It just added to the confusion of the film.<br /><br />FINAL VERDICT: I like films that have a story that makes sense and not so confusing. So, I don't care for this one and don't recommend it.\n",
      "Just some general observations: 1)The men are mostly spineless, flawed, and one-dimensional. It reminds me of Dennis Miller's story about the Lifetime channel production of \"Guys and Dolls\", renamed \"Oppressors and Women of Vision and Strength\".<br /><br />2) This show was obviously written with its PC liberal feminist heart on its sleeve. The Indian woman who can't decide whether she wants to be a doctor stayed around way too long, and spouts her disgust with American culture at every turn. Corday is a slut, and Kovach (sp?) is a womanizer. Weaver is just not believable as a lesbian; her naming the trans-gender studies unit after Romano smacked of childish revenge.<br /><br />3)I miss George Clooney and Anthony Edwards and Julianne Margulies (what a babe). I always felt that their performances (esp. Edwards') were classy and understated.<br /><br />4) It gets worse and worse. Where is \"The Day After\" when you really need it? This show needs to be put out of its (and our)misery, and soon. I put it in the same category of mindless drivel like Seventh Heaven and Touched by a Whiny Irish Angel.\n",

      "I have never really watched the show except I by chance caught one episode called If Not Now. Central to the theme of the show was the topic of abortions. I am extremely disappointed in how they misrepresented people and circumstances. A girl is raped and since her parents are Catholics they are represented as unreasonable. Furthermore, the parents explanation to the doctors as to why they do not want their daughter to have an abortion are presented as fanatical and not looking for the best interest of their daughter. This can't be farther from the truth. Most parents who are strongly opposed to abortion maintain more values than this show exhibited. Parents as these are not only looking out for their new grandchild, but they are also considering the long term effects their daughter may suffer. Further, a scenario such as this accounts for a mere 1% of the abortions that occur. This particular case supports the all too common misperception that the main reason abortions are an option is due to cases of rape and incest.\n",

      "During the early 80s, squatters in Berlin have been mostly students on an adventure holiday, some years later they were mostly full time bums on a permanent \"Do you have a Mark to spare\"-quest. They had their fair amount of street fighting activities, their weapon of choice was the cobble, and sometimes they threw it through the glass of a bank building. But they were no terrorists. Maybe wannabe revolutionaries, in their dreams. Nobody took them really serious.<br /><br />Now some of them seem to have made this movie. Just let me tell you what happens during the first 15 minutes.<br /><br />A group of Berlin squatters decides to blow up an empty old villa. Must be a very evil villa, because basically squatting was about saving empty buildings from neglect.<br /><br />They do an amateur movie about this heroic deed, maybe they think there is a market for Building-Snuff-Videos.<br /><br />Their bomb doesn't explode. They don't care, they just forget about the whole thing. Even though the entrance they took was very obvious and easy to detect, the next 13 years nobody enters the villa.<br /><br />Not even the real estate agent who in 2000 wants to show it to a client. Why should she make sure that there are no unpleasant surprises waiting inside, like squatters, homeless, garbage, animals, broken mains, collapsing floors ... ? The main door will not open, so the client uses some force to open it, and the old bomb, that had been waiting patiently behind it, finally explodes. He and the real estate newbie get slightly hurt.<br /><br />The client has been a government big shot. Hell breaks loose, police raids start.<br /><br />Of course, amongst their prime suspects are two veteran squatters, who still stay at a formerly occupied tenement-house. The police confiscates .... all of their super-8-films. Believe me, they really do, I'm not making this up, it's even the main part of the plot: The Berlin police in the year 2000, looking for some bomb-building terrorists confiscates the 80s super-8-films of some broken down bums. Please don't ask why. But imagine how the authors and producers had to get people interested in such a story. And they succeeded, which is even more unlikely.<br /><br />The two die-hard squatters will try to get the band together again and rescue what contained once proud memories of their glory days and now fatal evidence of their stupidity from the well guarded chambers of the police.<br /><br />By now you will know that you are not watching a movie, but are instead trapped inside the dream of some pathetic drunken 80s squatters, \"a bunch of mindless jerks who'll be the first against the wall when the revolution comes\". Frightening? No, just a strange and boring childish mind-scape.<br /><br />I realize that there really IS a market for stuff like this, the infamous lovers of dilettantish and inane films. Here they'll find a lot for their liking. This is a very, VERY bad movie, and by all means, they should check it out.\n",

The ending, witch is different from the book is not bad, is absolutely awful. One of the worst endings I've seen, no substance, no logic, the ending in the book is much good. If you seen this movie in your childhood, I recommend not to see it again. If you didn't see it, I recommend you to avoid seeing. The book is really good, I recommend you read it instead of watching this.\n",
      "... when the network was carpet-bombing trailers that were possibly the least funny and interesting promos in the history of cinema -- does anyone else think, for instance, that the plummeting of the credibility and popularity of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire dates from Regis Philbin hawking \"Bob's book\" as having made a huge difference in his life, on the Millionaire set yet, among other network celebrities pretending that Bob Patterson was a genuine motivational speaker? <br /><br />This show lived up to that degree of promise. I would say that Bob Patterson was a flaming heap of dreck, but that presupposes it was exciting enough to be considered \"flaming.\" Dormant, washed-out heap of dreck is more like it. <br /><br />What I don't understand is this. Who were the network moguls who watched the rushes and signed off on it? Now for a big star, yeah, you take a dive on it because of the money invested and the name recognition. But this is *Jason Alexander* we're talking about.

      "\"Shiryo No Wana 2: Hideki\" is a vile and repulsive movie which tries in vain to emulate the success of the first \"Evil Dead Trap\" but ultimately ends up as a vastly inferior sequel(in name only). While \"Hideki\" is visually quite intriguing, the story is a contrived mess filled with unlikable characters, an inane plot and cheap gross out effects that are more laughable than terrifying. Unlike genuinely creepy Japanese Horror films like the recent \"Ringu\", \"Uzumaki\", \"Ju-On\" and \"Spiral\", \"Hideki\" has less to do with atmospheric horror and more to do with over-the-top splatter similar to late 80's and early 90's films like \"Hellraiser\", \"Re-Animator\" and \"Naked Lunch\". Director Izo Hashimoto (who directed episodes of the campy Japanese TV show \"Sukeban Deka\" [Juvenile Cop]) tries too hard to go for the cheap thrills and scares. This is a real disappointment as I liked his \"Sukeban Deka\" TV work. To be avoided.\n",

It's supposed to be 'shock-cinema', so I expected something in the line of Cannibal Holocaust, or C. Ferox, etc. But this is a joke !! Perhaps I do not grasp the fine art of oriental cinema, but MY GOD is this a major flunker !!! There are so many opportunities that are left alone, so many gaps in the story, so petty acting !! No horrorfan can just sit back and enjoy EDT2, it is a disgrace to the genre...after 1 hour and 28 minutes you see one or two better scenes (breaking the arm is one of them, but still not impressive), and that's about it I'm affraid. So if you see this one on the shelf, start running the other direction, it SUCKS bigtime !!! Trauma !\n",
      "The beginning of this movie had me in tears of laughter the guy who opens who tries so hard to look scared just had me doubled over in fits of amusement I honestly thought \"What The ?\" this guy is confused maybe he got stuck in the wrong movie.<br /><br />There are a few scares in this movie but all of which are of the cheap variety for example \"ghostly shadow walks past in background\" \"deathly face in mirror\" \"hand coming out of the ground\" the list really does go on and that is where all the scares come from seriously. The acting is very flawed and quite comical although I am sure that was not their intention.<br /><br />You cant really take this movie seriously and it is quite unbelievable that movies such as this are made but even more weird they are unleashed on the unsuspecting public.<br /><br />So unless you like the thought of a cheap chill and a laugh or too then you should most definitely stay away from this movie.\n",

Meanwhile, the girlfriends Jennifer and Kiyomi are searching for flowers in the same woods. When Flipp and Kiyomi vanish, their friends meet each other and stay together while a deranged hunter chases new victims for the vengeful spirit of the tree.<br /><br />\"Haunted Tree\" has a reasonable premise, but a very poor and flawed execution. There are many low budget horror movies that work, usually based on solid screenplays and great performances. Unfortunately this flick has a terrible and messed screenplay, and the story begins without any previous development of the characters, probably because of the restraint in the budget. Therefore, the viewer sees Sean, Josh, Flipp, Jennifer and Kiyomi, and even the forest, without any reference or explanations about their motives for being in the dark and distant place. When Josh shots his gun, surprisingly neither Jennifer nor Kiyomi listen to the noise. The girls lose their car (is it possible?) and there is no explanation why they have come to such a distant place without tent or appropriate outfits. Nobody eats in this film, and the day is extremely short. Satinka is a rip-off of typical ghosts of Asian movies, and recalls Sadako of \"Ringu\" franchise. There are so many flaws that I could extent my review, but I believe this is enough to give a hint about this film. My vote is four.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): Not Available\n",
      "**Maybe Spoiler**<br /><br />Wow man, thats that kind of movie that o starts and get excited about. A promising start, a plot that is interesting, some interesting act at the beginning... but hey, don't get yourself enjoying yet. This movie could be very, very scary and hypnotic but instead, the movie lost itself on the half way and never find the way home. When I finished watching this and saw my girlfriend's face, well, needless to say, crap movie at all. A freak bad ending, boring story about a tale of an Tree that was in some level, connected to the family. Sevy Di Cione really tried to get into it but the hole story didn't help him. Kiralle Hayashi saved the \"Horror\" category of this movie, her appearances was scary most of the time and she has that look, that side look that makes you really think about if your alone or not in the room. I can't say much of this movie anymore, when it try to connect past/future in real life and kind of strange connection by dream/reality well, thats where it messed every thing up.<br /><br />But, I always think that movie is moment, maybe you like it. Give it try.\n",
      "\"Haunted Forest\" failed as far as originality and the general storyline was completely ubiquitous and inconsequential, but while actually keeping me JUST interested enough with it's very unusual look. The majority of this movie takes place in broad daylight, under clear skies, in a forest full of roads... Sure, not the best setting in which to derive \"scares\", yet there are some excellently perpetrated scenes involving ominous and jolting ghost encounters in a genuinely - and dare I say - refreshing way! Many shameless and creepy split-second moments, plus a decently strange ending kept the movie \"alive\" throughout it's runtime, though it is difficult to ignore the shlocky and convoluted premise and over-used, rambling explanation including dead Native Americans, a soul inhabited tree, and a crazy hunter with some kind of \"curse\" upon him... This was all weak and pretentious drivel that I couldn't have found less affective. My biggest gripe over \"Haunted Forest\", aside from the previously mentioned and the lack of gore, would definitely be the ungodly horrible acting. Was there even any dialog in this movie? There might as well have been none... Such boring characters and just the sight of them, at times, tempted me to cease my viewing of the film. Also, the ghost began looking more and more like that of \"The Ring\", and those close-ups of the eye and the draping, black hair annoyed me. Overall, it has it's mildly enjoyable features, though nothing of any great necessity for horror fans...\n",
      "Poorly cast, uninteresting location, amateur storytelling. <br /><br />This is one of those movies that crams in all the back story just as it is getting to the resolution. <br /><br />You can imagine the writers scrambling to think up an explanation for their ghost.<br /><br />Not original, unsatisfactory payoff, and some scenes with a waterfall that I guess takes takes you to a separate section of the forest that is otherwise inaccessible.<br /><br />I will say that the special effects surprised me, in as much as they seemed much more accomplished than any other aspect of the movie. <br /><br />I like B-movies, exploitation, horror, and trash, but I wasn't into this.<br /><br />The ghost was supposed to be Native American but looked totally Asian.<br /><br />The picked very uninteresting woods to film in.\n",
      "If a tree sucks you up in a haunted forest, would there be a reason to watch it? There really wasn't much to appreciate from this film.<br /><br />Three friends go into a forest in search of a haunted tree that one of the groups grandfather had written about. Forests are scary by themselves, but you never really felt that in the film. Even the moments that were supposed to be scary, weren't.<br /><br />The actors were very forgettable, and the pace was as slow as a tree growing.<br /><br />IT just didn't deliver. It just seemed to be so many leaves in search of a tree.\n",
      "God! I am a big time fan of Horror movies, i get the thrill and excitement when i watch them. But, let me assure you this movie comes with no such package. It bores you to death.<br /><br />Based on some thought process, which is crazy to say the least, this movie revolves around a ghostly forest which has seen sufferings of a girl some 200 years ago. Who suddenly decides \"Its my time, folks\"! and she kills...<br /><br />An American, an Englishman, and a stoner head into the forest in search of a hidden burial ground (just wait for the punch line). Sean, the American, has his grandfather's leather-bound journal, which details the horrific reign of Satinka, a malicious tree ghost with sharpened twigs for fingers who haunts the forest. Using the journal and the final photographs of a vanished tourist, the trio are intent on locating Satinka's haunted tree and the sacred burial ground that lies beneath. A couple of female botany students wander into the plot, apparently to keep things interesting.<br /><br />It turns out Satinka was an American Indian who was killed by some crazy white boys intent on driving out all the Injuns. She exacts her revenge by stabbing victims with wood slivers, thus marking them, and then sucking them into the ground. Despite Satinka's Native American heritage, she looks and moves like pretty much every Asian ghost you've seen in J-horror movies (and their American remakes) since The Eye, black hair hanging in her face, dark eyes, crawling in stutters and jerks across the forest floor, with the sound of snapped twigs accompanying her arrival.<br /><br />Please avoid watching it and wasting time.\n",
      "Director Ken Cameron, a former high school instructor, attempts here to transpose some of his teaching experiences to the screen, apparently conceptually convincing enough to garner guaranteed funding from the Australian Film Commission along with the Merchant/Ivory production team, but any points of interest that may have been persuasive to his financial angels are lost in the completed production. Set and filmed in a cheerless lower class district of Sydney, with its casting auditions held at various schools of that city for many of the younger featured players, the piece won an award at Cannes Junior, yet there is precious little to sustain viewer interest in most sequences, responsibility for this shortcoming falling upon Cameron's disjointed screenplay. The storyline follows the fundamentally aimless and anti-social activities of Steve Carson (a ferret-like Rod Zuanic), who occupies his time by selling drugs, stealing, lying, cheating, etc., for no particular reason, while providing very little of entertainment value for viewers, and even less for the high school teachers and administrators who must have dealings with him. Steve's father is an unemployed sot, his mother has left the home to be with another man, and his older brother utilizes him as a schoolyard dope dealer, plainly a dispiriting background for the youth, but as depicted one feels no sympathy for him, as his deportment appears to stem from stupidity rather than as reaction to socio/economic pressures in this erratically paced work wherein puerile incident assumes precedence above character development. Additionally, young Carson's family members, equally moronic fellow students, and school staff are seldom well-drawn, the only characters of abiding interest being Sharon (Tracey Mann), a new teacher at the high school and, in particular, \"Redback\" (Steve Bisley), owner of a junkyard for motorcycles, who gives Steve an opportunity to learn a trade (welding) and also to restore a wrecked motorcycle, thereby opening a way for the boy to flee from an uncivil environment. Because Cameron fails to unify his visuals with potential effects that may be felt from the script, a viewer will find it difficult to empathise with Steve, whose general behaviour fails to demonstrate knowledge of possible linkage between causes of his actions (theft, drug sales, et alia) and their consequences, with apparent altruism by Redback being the film's sole strong positive component. Bisley, a top-flight actor, gives his role some depth, but we are too often in the company here of juvenile halfwits, directionless slum based teenagers who fittingly cluster at various trash dumps. The characters actually have no place to go, nor does the episodic plot, and a viewer should care a little about those performers with whom time is shared in a film, but few will be apt to do so in this instance.\n",
      "John Bunny (as Tupper) is intrigued by a newspaper item announcing the arrival of heiress Flora Finch (as Rachel Whipple). The rotund Mr. Bunny would like to win wealthy Ms. Finch's hand in marriage. Believing that Finch would prefer a bachelor to a widower, he packs up his two daughters, and sends them away. To further impress the lady, he starts a baseball team. When Finch exclaims, \"I simply adore base ball players!\" Bunny wonders if she might like players more than owners",
      "<br /><br />Bunny was the prototype overweight comedian. Compared to the other actors, his complexion looks very bad in \"Hearts and Diamonds\". Though I am judging more from touched-up movie stills than movies, I was surprised at his unhealthy appearance. Perhaps, the illness that would soon claim him had some effect. Finch doesn't have as much to this time around; though, she and Bunny always make a striking couple. <br /><br />*** Hearts and Diamonds (9/26/14) George D. Baker ~ John Bunny, Flora Finch, Charles Eldridge, William Shea\n",
      "This movie reminded me of a not so much of a hit film of 1993 called \"Phir Teri Kahaani Yaad Aayee\", starring Pooja Bhatt. Comparing Pooja Bhatt to Kangana, you may feel disappointed, but in her own way, Kangana has tried very hard. Shiny Ahuja is marvelous as always. I don't know why but I came out of the movie blaming him, as if it was he who sought relief of his previous self, when he was a child. At major points, the movie is a direct lift from \" A Beautiful Mind\". Partly misdirected, the story is strong and actors good. Kangana looks good in the movie. At some points, there is also a \"horror\" film effect that has been tried. It was meant in good stead, but has been overdone. Also, only a few songs are good, the rest mediocre. Overall, watch it if nothing better to do and a few hours to kill, else can be avoided in favor of Phir Teri....( which would be very hard to find)\n",
      "It would be nice to see once a Hindi movie that is not taken off from American Movies. I found Kangana's character very similar to Gia. In Gia, Gia is an international famous model whose life spirals downwards due to heroine addiction and dies due to AIDS. With Kangana her character Sana has a mental problem that it costs her her life and her boyfriend played by Shiny to take care of (Gia had her mother for those who don't know). Throw in a twist of the imaginary person and her perception that the world is trying to get her and you add in Gia with Beautiful Mind. If you tried to fool us thinking this was an original idea....you didn't. Comeon, come up with a movie that is original....can Bollywood do that on a consistent basis..?? So far, I think not! I give it 3/10 for lack of creativity.\n",
      "I had great hopes for this movie, which I rented after reading other comments, and also based on my previous experience with some excellent Cuban movies. This one turned out to be the worst, with no substance, poor dialog, and an incredible lack of action. Passion is shown as something evil, to be avoided by all means. The scenes of fainting people everywhere are beyond the limits of stupidity. Some of the characters are beyond fantasy, as is the recurrent idea of coincidence against all odds. Having met friends who recently came from Havana, it is clear that the director avoided showing the miserable state of that city. It is hard to believe that this awful creation received any award ever. The only reason I give it a 3 out of 10 is out of respect for most of the main actors, who were pitifully wasted.\n",
      "Ok, I know just about everyone claims that the most recent bad film they've seen is the worst movie ever made. Well, it's been a while since the 1995 release of Wally White's ode to self-absorption \"Lie Down with Dogs,\" and the film still ranks as the worst gay movie devoted to celluloid, and an atrocity on all levels. Here's 10 reasons why the film makes more sucking noises than a Hoover upright: ***1. Our \"protagonist\" (and I use that term VERY loosely) waxes unpoetically at the beginning of the film about how sucky New York City is, so he packs up and moves, haphazardly, to Provincetown, MA for the summer. Once there, he does nothing but berate the place for not being New York. Go figure. ***2. The film was obviously shot during P-Town's off-season; the summer resort looks more like an old-west ghost town. ***3. We're supposed to feel a sense of connection and brotherhood with Tommy, the lead character. Yeh, right. It's probably unintentional, but White's alter-ego is a whining, self-obsessed doink who is about half as attractive as he thinks he is. I'm supposed to root for this guy to fall in love? I found myself rooting for this guy to be hit by a bus. ***4. The film is extremely offensive to minorities. White tries to be funny, but instead manages to insult everyone from recovering alcoholics to men over 40 to Jamaicans. Even the latino pretty boy is (gasp!) lazy... one of a bazillion stereotypes perpetuated by this wreck of film. ***5. White's summer vacation is boring. I had more exciting stints at summer camp as a kid. ***6. The writing of this film is amateurish through and through. What's meant to be funny is just obnoxious, and what's meant to be touching is cloying. The characters are flat, the plot is nil and there's no dramatic rise to what little story exists. ***7. The director makes the assumption that all gay men aspire to be pumped-up pretty-boy airheads, dancing in their speedos. No, thanks, I'm driving. ***8. Cinematically, the film is poorly constructed. The editing is bad, the camerawork is bland. The movie looks like someone grabbed a camera for the first time and thought, \"wow, I'll make a movie.\" ***9. Did I mention that the lead character is self-absorbed and obnoxious? ***10. The worst offender of all: the utter horror of the \"Square State Theory\" scene. This little gem sees Tommy as he unfolds his hypothesis that you can tell a guy from a square-shaped state by his tacky wardrobe, lack of dancing expertise or general ugliness. To make matters worse, he actually points out several of these hapless losers out while pontificating from on high in a crowded dance club. ***Can you tell how offended I was by this movie? As a guy from a relatively square state, I have news for Wally White... first, you might be part of a minority, but this kind \"better than thou\" behavior isn't far off from what fueled such lovely historical eras such as Nazi Germany. Secondly, those square-state guys are PEOPLE... they may know how to point and laugh, too, but things like self-contentment and decency usually stand in their way. Me, I guess I'm not so decent, so I have no shame or reservation when I tell you: your film is mean-spirited and just plain bad.\n",
      "this movie has elements of other movies,some better(Cujo,Man's Best friend)some not as good(Rottweiler).the idea of a group of people stranded on an island and fighting for their lives is nothing new,either.this particular movie doesn't really add anything new to the genre.it's also pretty slow,with not very much suspense or tension.yet i found it just interesting enough to be entertaining.by entertaining,i mean,i think's worth a cheap rental,and i wouldn't buy it unless you can get it cheap.for me,the movie held promise,but just didn't deliver.i wasn't overly interested in any of the characters.for me,The Breed is a 4/10\n",
      "Well basically the premise for the film itself does not bode well really. Genetically modified hounds? I think I can see what's going to happen. Oh s**t lovers! And rain! Would more would I need to know there's dark times ahead? S**T DON'T GO HUNTING AND TALK ABOUT DOGS! HAVE YOU NOT READ THE BLURB! Is it called blurbs when referring to films? I'm not too sure. Don't bother talking about relationships. Chances are either you or your love interest will die. NIGGA GONNA DIE! Oh creepy shots. Oh noes he is surrounded by the doggies! THE DOGS DON'T WANT YOU HERE. Fair enough, but do they really need to tear him apart? Just send him on his way. I'm sure that would work. F**K YES HE SHOT THE WOMAN WITH AN ARROW. (is shot the right word?) They are genetically modified by giving them rabies that don't kill you? So basically the rage virus from 28 days later but for dogs. A DOG IN THE HOUSE. S**T I DON'T THINK THEY REALISED DOGS CAN SWIM TOO! Back to the house! Should have listened to the brother. He knows where its at. ZIPWIRE IS THE FUTURE THEY SAID. Haha it stopped short. Dogs are an awful enemy. Dolphins would be much better. HOW THE HELL DID THE DOG JUMP ONTO THE ROOF? DOG? IN HOUSE? HOW MANY TIMES? In the attic! (Not) making a porno! S**t you're IN A CAR. There are DOGS running at you. What do you do? DRIVE OFF A CLIFF! (almost) F**K THE DOG IS IN THE WINDOW. The dogs whelps are possibly the best thing about the film. Yep. love interest died. No one cares. NIGGA GONE MISSING. No one cares. On a boat. No one cares. OH S**T THEY HAVE DOG AIDS. THE END. FIN. Bare in mind I stopped writing the s**t that happened at the end. It was awful. Well they did get dog aids at the end. But before that it was simply s**t.\n",
      "Why is it that some directors let us their name to promote bad movies, Do they get well payed or what? This movie here is an example of a bad one promoted by Wes Craven. It starts of pretty well with a couple getting lost at sea, seeing an island and getting ashore. The dump blond of course go wandering around in the forest and gets attacked by some dogs. The end of the girl. That really is the best part of this bad movie. Then we see the arrival of friends, and of course they got beaten by the breed. First of all, there isn't anything spectacular in this movie, no gore, almost no blood no suspense. What we get is a lot of blah blah and some showing off of the skills of Rodriguez. You can see the killings coming from miles away. Why the dogs are on the island is silly. When an arrow hits the leg of a girl there's no blood running and in the next scene's she's just walking and running around. Well Wes, if you still are promoting those kind of horrors then surely this will be your last appearance on the set, got it?\n",
      "OK, so i'm not the biggest horror fan in the world. I'll admit. usually i find the paper thin plots and laughable acting too much to bare. The only horror movies i can think of recently that have impressed me were 'The Devils Rejects' and '1408' - and this movie just completely reinstates my thoughts on why i generally avoid horrors. Lets see. First up they choose mans BEST friend as the 'monsters' - NO. Then they decide to stick with the ever familiar \"5 teens lost 'somewhere' plot - NO. They used REAL, ORDINARY dogs - NO. Come on Wes, i mean Jesus...at least try and mean 'em up a little bit. Coming off the back as such repellent crap as 'Cursed' (A werewolf that flips people off? Kill me now) it's no wonder this was a tad on the dire side. What made it even more pathetic was some of the actions performed by the placid characters. Why on earth other people reviewing this film are saying they acted 'Real' in those situations is beyond me. Heres where we get into spoilerville...<br /><br />1) John is an excellent marksman, yet he manages to miss one dog randomly and hit a girls leg even though every other shot in the movie he makes is dead on. Not to mention the fact he has a sack load of arrows and a whole bunch of times he could have simply started picking the dogs off one by one. But no, that'd be too easy.<br /><br />2) The car in the garage that has been sat rusting for years works first time they try and then....surprise surprise. Not when they need it.<br /><br />3) The dogs can climb on board a planes wing, but not over a little fence.<br /><br />4) At one point, this guy (yeah...i didn't care enough to remember his name) has 20 baying dogs on him as he rushes to the car, yet, finds time to take his jacket off (an attack PROTECTION jacket) before he gets in the car? Why, oh why? <br /><br />5) You're on an island, full of killer dogs, driving a car you know they can easily jump on and in. Yet you leave the F'ing windows down? come on now.<br /><br />6) They drop the bow (retardedly) and pass by the same direction they dropped it on the way back to the house (NOT being pursued at this point). Do they think to check and grab it? Nah....too easy.<br /><br />7) The black guy dies first. *Sighs*<br /><br />8) They know the dogs can break into there house, as they had done before. Yet they still decide to stay downstairs and have a PARTY? *Sighs again* <br /><br />9) The ending.....oh lordy lord, the ending...they had serious options for a semi-entertaining ending. The guys could have gone nuts and turned on each other like fighting dogs then Michelles character. They could have both just turned on Michelle, they could have let them been saved and then showed the virus spreading to another place. No, they went the James Bond route. I was half expecting Odd Job to jump out and start swinging bowler hats at people.<br /><br />10) Just...ahhhhhh! How annoying are you people! <br /><br />So yeah.....If you like your horrors full of cute pets that are a little bit mean to people, actors that need a slap in the face for even attempting any realism, the stupidest scenarios you can imagine and one liners that would make Arnie the govenator cringe, this is your movie.<br /><br />There's worse movies out there (Strangers with candy anyone?) but as far as movies go this is pure drivel. I work at Blockbusters and got this rental for free. Do NOT part with any cash for this film. In fact, steal it, and burn it. Michelle....sort it out love. And Wes...If you don't make another Nightmare On Elm Street soon your reputation in the horror business is as good as (the living) dead.<br /><br />Avoid.\n",
      "This movie is a disaster from beginning to end and I justify my summary because even though it is suppose to be a terror movie there is not terror anywhere. The idea that normal looking dogs could ever be scary enough just by showing their teeth is something that beggars belief. Even if a genetic experiment was done on the dogs the movie is not scary at any point and look ridiculous. But there is something far worse and more sinister in this movie. We know they are good friends but it happens that once one of them falls victim to the dogs nobody really seems to care and they are left to their own luck. For instance, the black guy once he is bitten by two dogs in the cellar they don't seem even to try to rescue him from the dogs they shut the door and let the dogs finish him off or the guy they find in the woods wounded is left to be eaten by the dogs. This film is not believable at all and has many flaws. Why doesn't anybody grab a kitchen knife? I will not waste any more time on this review, I'll just sum it up. The plot is stupid, the idea ridiculous, not scary at all and full of flaws, discontinuity, badly written and thought out. My vote has to be 1 out of 10.\n",
      "At first, I was all hyped up to see this film, mainly because I am a fan of Michelle Rodriguez. I have nothing bad to say about her, Taryn Manning on the other hand, well, let's just say that she must have had sex with all the right people to even have a career in show business because I just don't get it. What the hell is she doing here? The woman just plain sucks! With the exception of Michelle Rodriguez, this entire movie has the worst cast, the worst crew, and the dumbest story ever pulled out of a writer's butt! My advice: All fans of Michelle Rodriguez should watch this movie at home with the sound turned all the way down, because watching her is the only true enjoyment this dud of a movie has to offer, And That's All There Is Too It...\n",
      "It seems likely that the only thing getting 'The Breed' off the shelves is the lure of it's young cast, and in particular, its co-stars Michelle Rodgriguez and Oliver Reed. Or, at least it might suffice, as the random date movie title for younger viewers. For all else, The Breed, is little more than a template horror movie that, although has the rare incentive of decent acting, offers extremely limited thrills or even decent writing.<br /><br />The story centers on a group of friends--two of them being brothers--who return to their uncle's old cabin on some forested island, unaware that it is infested with a pack of vicious dogs that have either contracted a furious case of rabies or have escaped a genetic experiment (the writers seem to have a hard time deciding on which they'd rather go with, despite the stupidity in character's reasoning for the former). And that is essentially what the eighty some minutes of screen time boils down to--escaping the dogs. And of course, all that follows is from beginning to end is completely standard from the black guy getting killed first to the divergent brothers forced settle their differences when their lives depend on it.<br /><br />It's quite the forgettable movie.\n",

Nothing and a grown man trying to get passed off as an adopted son please give me a break wake up and smell the coffee.Is everyone punch drunk?Get the real story thats worth telling.Much was missing from this mans life his mother was the driving force behind him and the only mention she got was did Griffith remember when she died?

      "Considering that this bad episode followed another horrid episode (the one about the crew fighting it out at the OK Corral), it was obvious that the quality of the show was starting to slip. Despite the one very glowing review so far, it must be hard for readers to know what to make of the show since they only two reviews are polar opposites. Read on and decide for yourself.<br /><br />The Enterprise respond to a distress call which turns out to be a trap by some Klingons. Through some odd coincidences that few seem to question, many Klingons are beamed aboard the Enterprise and an all-out war erupts--complete with swords and other ancient weapons. All the phasers magically have disappeared and the decks have been sealed off sort of like an arena. And, when people die, they magically heal themselves and fight on and on and on--all to the delight of a spinning ball of light that looks like it was created by spinning a prism. Eventually, Kirk is able to get himself out of his battle frenzy that was imposed by the spinning ball and convinces everyone to just be pals and laugh the problem away--at which point, brotherhood and the chorus of KUMBAYA drive away the evil force and all is back to normal (okay, the \"Kumbaya\" thing didn't happen--but it was almost THAT bad!). I feel myself gagging as I type--yecch what a preachy and stupid episode. It sure could have been better if they had kept the plot but given it some decent resolution that wasn't so cloying as well as better special effects to represent the creature. This is probably in the top five of the worst Star Trek episodes.\n",
      "Jane Wyman and Allen Jenkins team up as the reporter/detective pair in their first but also the series final episode. Wyman looks great but simply does not have the wisecracking hard-boiled presence of the annoying Glenda Farrell. Jenkins is fair but Barton MacLane is better.<br /><br />As in the rest of the series and many other films of this type, the amateur is a necessary component of bringing the criminal to justice. Torchy goes undercover in jail and on the lam in order to meet up with the notorious Denver Eddie. By the end of the movie she is in the arms of fiancé Detective Lieutenant Steve McBride. <br /><br />Tom Kennedy steals most of the movie by playing a former Navy wrester turned policeman. In reality Tom was a boxer and he carries off his match as Harry the Horse with Bone Crusher (played by Tiny Roebuck in his final on-screen performance) with good comedic style. If you have ever wondered what the protagonists in a wrestling match say to each other while they are otherwise locked into their imposing holds, watch this movie.\n",
      "Wow - this movie is unbelievable. The tone of the whole thing is so Jeckyl and Hyde - you have to laugh. The film opens with grave quotes from law enforcement experts on how teen gangs are the \"corrosive acid to our society\" and so on, and then the movie opens with a bunch teen gang members driving around to a song so non-threatening, so soft, so flaccid that it is unintentionally hilarious. The song \"Baby, Slow Down\" sounds like soft rock that even Firefall wouldn't sing.But the best part is the lead role - this guy is supposed to be this dangerous, seething guy capable of rape, murder, etc. and the \"actor\" who plays Cat looks like he should be singing Godspell or Joseph & The Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat. He's blonde, blue eyed and slightly effeminate - so its a riot when he's threatening black drug dealers or knife wielding Mexicans - this is the kind of movie where some of the supposed high schoolers are played by people who look thirty (like the guys in shower who are knifed). One interesting side note - a young John Ashton plays a high school coach who might have \"seen something\" - he's easily the best actor in the film (and there is plenty of bad acting) but Ashton went on to big hits like Beverly Hills Cop (he's Judge Reinholds, grumpy partner) and Midnight Run (where he's the sleazy bounty hunter competing with DeNiro). The film is filled with wimpy guys doing Grease talk, mixed in with Bowery Boys and yet some harsh violence. A mess. A weird mess.\n",
      "This is without doubt one of the worst films I have ever seen. Almost everything about it is awful, especially the editing. This is no exaggeration. Watch something like Nosferatu, which was made in 1922, and then watch this, made over 50 years later and wonder why editing technology hasn't advanced in such a large period of time. The only thing this film is good for is that it's so bad you may have wet yourself by the end (which is crap, as if you had to be told). One of the worst films ever.\n",
      "The first live action cartoon based film with Walther Matthau and little Mason Gamble is quite amusing, and this was straight-to-video sequel attempt. Basically Dennis Mitchell (Liar Liar's Justin Cooper) still causes misery for old neighbour George Wilson (Toy Story's Don Rickles), his wife Martha (Betty White) likes her and keeps reminding him he's a child. Mr. Wilson wishes Dennis could bother another old man, and along comes Grandpa (Thunderbolt and Lightfoot's George Kennedy) to take him out a little bit, but it is obvious he doesn't have as much time as he thought. Mr. Wilson isn't just worrying about how Dennis will make his life misery, he is worried that he is ageing too quickly, and cons the Professor (Brian Doyle-Murray) and Sylvester (Scott 'Carrot Top' Thompson) who in various disguises are trying to trick him into giving them loads of his money. Dennis meanwhile is not only causing chaos for Mr. Wilson and one or two other people in the neighbourhood, but he can't rid of \"girlfriend\" Margaret (Jacqueline Steiger), who wants to marry him. Dennis catches on to the con artists sponging off Mr. Wilson, and he saves the day in the end, and Mr. Wilson sees that Dennis does have his good side, for about ten minutes. Also starring Dwier Brown as Henry Mitchell, Heidi Swedberg as Alice Mitchell and Spy Kids' Alexa Vega as Gina. Cooper might be cute as the disaster prone little troublemaker, and the sequence where he tries to wash a car with candy floss mix instead of pink soap was amusing, but young Steiger is like the four-eyed equivalent of Annie, i.e. irritating, and it is a dull story, unfunny and just an overall boring family comedy. Pretty poor!\n",
      "Is this movie ever horrifyingly awful. The first one was absolutely great and I can't believe they bothered with this and thought they could pass it off as a DTM movie. Don Rickles sucks as an actor and sucks even worse as Mr. Wilson. The kid playing Dennis is atrocious as him and this movie is just so over the top fake and unrealistic beyond forgiveness. It is already a very short movie and the length it is is already too long. To say it's not as good as the first is so far beyond an understatement it's ridiculous. Stay as far away from this piece of puke as humanly possible. Giving it a 2 is already being quite generous and that's right near the absolute bottom.\n",
      "This is a movie directed at young children (I watched it with my little brother), who will eat up the slapstick and inept adults. If you have seen the first contemporary version starring Mason Gamble, don't see this. Justin Cooper (\"Liar,Liar\" and \"Home Alone 3\") in not even half as good as was Gamble in the first.<br /><br />This movie would be totally worthless if not for the cinematography of Christopher Faloona. He uses strange camera angles (lots of overhead shots) and employs some cool tricks with the focus. This is the only thing that kept me from rating this movie a 1.<br /><br />My Grade: 2\n",
      "the first one was bad enough , why didnt they quit while they were ahead?? and the thing i dont get, if its a sequel.. whats with all the characters being played by different actors in this one???<br /><br />i only seen part of it . but it was SO stupid that i changed the channel....<br /><br />\n",
      "the first one was so cute. not one of the original actors returned for the sequel. it really doesn't even have a plot. there's nothing likable about rickles' mr. Wilson, unlike the walter matthau character in the original. and the dennis character can't hold a candle to the first! the 2 crooks in this are just plain silly. betty white is fine as mr.s Wilson, but we don't even get to know her. and the characters of dennis' parents are so wooden, they could have just used cardboard cutouts instead. the margaret character was just plain silly. i don't even know why they wasted their time to make a sequel. please don't waste your time with this stinker.\n",
      "Producers of Vaastu-Shastra warns: it you watch this film we shall not be responsible means that if you regret after watching it, blame it yourself as we already warned you. Final word, watch it at your own risk.<br /><br />Nothing much in the name of story-a couple, writer-husband (why he is shown a writer? don't know) and doctor-wife (why is she a doctor-don't know ?) with their little son and a sister-in-law comes to stay at a deserted house in the middle of a jungle. Perfect setting for chills and thrills. Why they need to come down to a place 20 km away from city, again don't know ? Now that house is haunted. Ghosts make frequent visits and some befriends the little boy, why only boy, don't know ? First the boy's evil-intentioned governess gets killed by ghosts. Later, Sister-in-law's boyfriend gets killed by ghosts and so is sister, when they are secretly mating in the house. In the end, an entire force of all dead people (Ghosts) appears to kill all those who are alive. Now if sole intention of the Ghosts is to kill the inhabitants of that house then why they waited till 2 hours of movie's running time, and get to work only in the climax. That's not all. There is even an insane man (Rajpal Yadav, now when is the last he played a sane character ?) who continuously warns about haunted house but is ignored by all. Why this character is needed, don't' know ? There is a ghostly tennis ball who does things on its own but later where it vanishes nobody knows ? For horror factor, there are some scary faces with loads of heavy makeup and lighting, but that's about it. <br /><br />The biggest suspense in the film is why it is named Vaastu-shastra, which you will not able to crack even when the film is over. Immensely talented debutant director Saurabh Usha Narang (see his episodes of Haqeeqat on Sahara One TV) and even the cameraman Sachin K Krishn not able to erect a better narrative on this deadly (or dead) plot. Merely, a noisy sound track (Ajay Kumar-Kunal Mehta) and a haunting score (Amar Mohile) can't hold the audience for about 2.10 hrs. The content level is low in the film. Performances just passes muster. There are no songs in the film and they are not needed also.<br /><br />At one place you find some relevance, when you see the name of production company The Factory. Indeed it is an assembly line product on the lines of previous Raat, Bhoot, Darna Mana Hai etc.<br /><br />Read another warning from producers- if Bhoot scared you, this one kill you ? Well Bhoot definitely scare never mind if the narrative is thin but is properly packed with all gimmicks of a horror flick but this one sorry to say kills only your expectations but yes it might kill your factory Mr. Producer if you continuously churn out such flicks. Now this is a warning from a concerned viewer, are you listening ?\n",
      "No Spoilers (there are no actual spoilers anyways)<br /><br />I just saw this movie at a preview in New Delhi(PVR) i.e. on Wednesday (two days before the release) and i was really looking forward to this one. But as in the case of most Hindi movies ,I was disappointed yet again. The movie starts off real slow with unwanted sound effects (not even effects but those silly bangs and booms to give the audience a jolt)(a cheesy one includes sounds of a tiger roar now and then) which sounded inappropriate at times. Well, nothing i mean NOTHING happens till one and a half hour of the movie(what happens is the same old sightings of those zombies roaming in the house) and what all happens after that is silly (totally silly).<br /><br />But the thing that bothered me most is that there are numerous plot holes in the story. In other words, this movie is made of three things: Plot holes, Plot holes and Plot holes. The screenplay (or the story) is pathetic. Many things remain unexplained and its like they are showing whatever they want to without even thinking about it once.<br /><br />First i thought 'God, they have copied 'The Shining' because there was this boy who goes about the house in his small cycle and his dad is a writer and then when he starts seeing the ghosts i thought 'Okay its Sixth Sense now' but it was not even so. The Ending sequences are really stupid and seems like the director and the screenwriter are complete idiots to have thought of making such trash. The visual effects were as if they are of a B movie and were nowhere near visual effects (a kid could have done them up).<br /><br />SPOILERS HEREIN - Those who want to know what it is about<br /><br />The kid sees a zombie family and roams around the house speaking to them and playing with them. The zombie children live on a Banyan Tree (don't know if Bargat ka pedh is Banyan) and there's a small shed in the backyard of the house also. Some stupid scenes include a ball hanging in the air going here and there.<br /><br />So his parents(The incredibly talented Sushmita Sen and that guy from Satya) hire a 'Bai' who steals their stuff and is hit by one of the Ghosts (zombies)(the scene is hilarious). She tells the boy not to tell his parents about her and even threatens to kill him. When he tells his parents they become worried coz of the weird things their child is talking about but then the maid gets killed and all the stuff is found which she stole so Sush realizes her kid was indeed seeing the ghosts all the while.<br /><br />Also there is that funny short guy from Main Madhuri Dixit Banna Chahti Hoon who features in all of Ramu's productions (He was also in Hungama). He seems to know the story behind the family in the house and jumps in front of Sush's car whenever she goes to the hospital (she is playing a doctor)<br /><br />Throughout the movie the kid keeps seeing the zombie family (which is not at all scary) and one night he and his parents go out for a movie, Sush's sis Radhika (played by Piya) is alone in the house and her boyfriend Murali comes to the house (Purab that channel [V] VJ) and starts playing with her in bed and then suddenly he disappears (The crappy part starts now).<br /><br />MAJOR SPOILERS<br /><br />Radhika starts searching him and then gets killed by the zombies. When Sush and people return they find Murali killed in bed and Radhika hanging by the tree. Even the husband gets killed and the boy is also smacked by the zombie family (who are now joined by Radhika and Murali zombies). Susmita comes to know about the tree through that mad guy (Small funny guy) and when she returns she sees her little boy lying on the floor and now her husband is also a zombie. She picks him up and runs for her life. Starts her car and goes round and round coz her neck is being held by her zombie hubby. Her car crashes into the tree and it goes on fire but Sush escapes out of the car and faints. The mad guy is very happy to see the tree in ashes and even pees in front of the tree but when he turns back the zombies are not gone. (Stupid no?).Sush wakes up in the hospital and finds her son okay and then when she picks him up the last shot of the scene shows the boy (her son) is also a zombie i.e. he died when the ghosts smacked him.<br /><br />All of these things are unexplained and are pretty dumb. Do not watch this movie and if you are very eager to see it... rent it on DVD or something. But i might add that the only thing worth watching is Susmita Sen and her acting (does a great job after Samay). But i sense that the director is good and should get another chance. Rating 2 out of 10\n",
      "5 star is good for it really it didn't seem like it wood be even a worth watch but it is. this was categorized as a scary movie..........to a 10 yr old he may pee his pants but i don't think it should for the later,this i would say because the ghosts in the movie(a Totally GRUDGE MOVIE RIP-OFF)are shown a lot of times in daytime.......that totally ruins it.....we can clearly see the white powder on the ghosts..............and lot of the movie is 'The Shining' 's RIP-Off.........i don't remember whats scenes are but some like when the kid rides the3 wheeler bicycle and the camera follows him like the same way in the shining......and the background music too was playing same.....DAMN!!!!,i would also say that the story is bit like the the shining.i didn't like the ending and the twist ain't that good too if u see the movie then i am sure ur gonna realize the fault that the director made (u will have to pay attention to know more faults .....there are a lot of faults) .....the ghosts die becoz the tree burns down becoz they wre living there but at the final shot they show that kid has become a ghost........how the hell did he get away ????i mean he should have died too after the tree burn down .it could have been better too bad it had to end like this......................The Whole movie could have been a better . but ill still rate it a worth watching film for its effort.........u don't get to see that lot scary movies in bollywood ,u get movies with stupid fake stunts with no good plot.\n",
      "I started cursing myself about 20 mins. after the start of the show. One tends to think what has happened to Ram Gopal Verma's quality of production. This movie certainly digressed from the main theme of horror movies - \"Its supposed to scare ya !\" .. <br /><br />Almost the entire movie is clichéd .. there is no proper story .. and the director thinks that by adding weird sounds, it will sound scary .. you could almost guess what was going to happen next .. there is no proper story in the movie ! There should have been some history about why the tree killed people .. why did all the people decide to appear in the end together ? why could they not start the carnage earlier .. pathetic movie .. sushmita can act and she does a good job but the direction and the story is just nonsense .. \"bhoot\" was so much better .. I just saw exorcist (the beginning) a couple of days back and I thought it was pretty good ..<br /><br />Man !! the next time I go to a Ram Gopal Varma production, I'm gonna make sure I don't got for the first day show, it would be more sensible to ask someone who has already seen the movie ... it seems he is losing his touch ..\n",
      "Ram Gopal Varma creates more mysterious garbage! This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It is so bizarre, repulsive, and stupid. Varma was right--this movie is very scary--so scary that it scared the audience out of the theaters! By the end of the movie, I was laughing my head off. That's not a good sign when you're watching a horror/thriller. The climax is so disgusting and utter nonsense! Do yourself a big favor and avoid this one! I must say, though, that the child artist was awesome! He really looked as if he just saw a ghost. He definitely deserves some awards for his performance. Sushmita also did a good job.\n",
      "This movie had a collection of interesting supporting actors such as Peter Cushing, Ronald Lacey, Trevor Howard and the great Sean Connery.<br /><br />However, it completely fails on the lack of acting ability of Miles O'Keefe, who did a lot of movies of the fantasy variety before being consigned to Direct to DVD Perdition.<br /><br />The plot is that Sir Gawain has been given a year to live by the magical Green Knight, after which if he has not solved four riddles, the Green Knight can have his head. After a series of adventures rescuing a fair maiden from the magical city of Lyonese, and a battle with evil forces, Gawain has a final confrontation with the Green Knight, by which time you really and truly will not care anymore.<br /><br />Parts of this movie look good, others look kind of cheesy even for 1984.\n",
      "Yes, Sean Connery did not want to be Bond forever and for the most part you can say he has done a rather good job of doing roles other than Bond. Then there are the head scratchers like that turn as a villain in the very dull \"Avengers\" movie. Or like here, where he decided to say the heck with serious acting let me be in one of those horrible films with one of those guys who can not act a lick in this case Miles O'Keefe, also seen in the dreadful \"Cave Dwellers\", which was also a sequel to another one that I have heard is bad itself Ator. Granted the movie \"Zardoz\" was strange too, and it made no sense as well, but it had a certain style and actually seemed to work even though there are still parts of it I have no clue as to what they were about. This one is just bad with an ending that makes one go what the heck just happened there. Did they not remember to write a good ending so they had to end it in the most vague possible manner. Not really much to say about this movie, only that Sean Connery is the only reason I gave this movie a two because he is a favorite actor of mine. However, he does not really add anything to this one, but it just makes the movie surreal just because an actor of his caliber is in it.\n",
      "Abysmal screen adaptation of \"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\" which not only frequently abandons the source material but is devoid of any of its themes or meanings. The result is a strictly one-dimensional swords and sandal shambles which fatally chooses to take itself seriously. Miles O'Keefe is as bland as one can be in the role of Gawain whilst the action sequences are staged totally without panache or energy. The sole highlight (for me, anyway) among the mess was Sean Connery's lively portrayal of the Green Knight yet its not enough to rescue the movie. Overall, the whole thing is a sorry excuse for a film production and (considering its release in an era where action-adventure was being taken to new heights through \"Star Wars\" and \"Indiana Jones\") one has to wonder what the filmmakers ever saw in it.\n",
      "I had to watch this movie in a medieval literature class I am taking in college, and to be quite frank, it was one of the worst films I have seen in the course of my life. The plot mixes both the story of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight and The Countess of The Fountain(a.k.a. Owein) but seems to leave out the whole meaning and message of each work of literature. To someone watching this movie, who has not read these works before may not be as...repulsed...by it as one who has.However, even someone with no knowledge of the texts will still not enjoy this movie.Really the only good thing about it is Sean Connery. I don't like giving bad reviews, but I just can't recommend this movie to anyone.\n",
      "This movie starts with a lot of promise. The opening scene, featuring Sean Connery, is very entertaining. However, Connery disappears for most of the rest of the movie along with any talent that anyone else may have exhibited. The movie jumps from place to place with no coherent story. There is no sense of time. The editing is laughable. After the first 5 minutes there is nothing worth watching in this film.\n",
      "When I first heard about this movie I knew right off the bat it would be hilariously bad. Think about it...first off it's made by Cannon, one of the most incompetent movie companies of all time (just about 95% of all the movies they ever made were laughably bad). Second, the hero of the story is none other than Miles O'Keefe himself wearing a big dopey blonde wig that makes him look more girlie than tough. Then to top it all off we have Sean Connery in a role he'd probably rather forget as the \"Green Knight\", but he looks more like a Christmas decoration then an actual magical knight. Not only is he covered from head to toe in green glitter, but he has pieces of holly stuck to his head! Throw all these into a blender and you have a really horrible unintentionally funny film.<br /><br />The story revolves around Sean Connery challenging all the knights at a particularly wimp-filled castle to use his own axe to chop off his head. The deal is they get one blow to chop Sean's head off, but if they don't succeed he in turn gets to take a chop at their head. At first none of the knights are willing to accept his challenge, but then when the King gets so frustrated at his weak kingdom and offers to accept Sean's deal himself, the brave Miles O'Keefe jumps in and accepts the challenge instead! The King is so proud he makes the young Miles O'Keefe an instant knight! What happens next is ridiculous. O'Keefe takes his swing and chops Sean's head clean off...but then a really fake Sean head laying on the floor is then seen telling his body to come and pick up his head. The headless body walks over to the head, picks it up, and puts it back on his neck. Miles O'Keefe, realizing that he's just been fooled by a magical knight into giving up his own life, prepares to have his own head chopped off in return. However, Sean Connery decides that he will grant the young O'Keefe one more year to live his life before he will chop off his head. He also gives O'Keefe a really boring riddle that if he solves in that year, his life will be spared.<br /><br />The rest of the movie revolves around Miles O'Keefe in a fake crappy stiff armor outfit traveling around the countryside trying to solve the riddle, fighting danger every step of the way. There are not only tons of cheesy battles, but movie mistakes galore and plot holes aplenty. If you're a bad movie fan then definitely check this one out. You'll be happy you did.\n",
      "This truly has to be the worst film ever, a bunch of five year olds would surely be able to write a better script, construct more realistic sets and props and act to a higher degree than the actors in this movie seem to have demonstrated and still be more understanding to historical accuracy!<br /><br />And can someone please explain the wigs? Surely not adding to historical accuracy (for any century!) or even 1984! Added to this the poor soundtrack which seems to suggest that the director, at gunpoint, forced some lonely spinster from the organ of a church in Dunny-On-The-Wolds, Surrey to sit down and construct (with a timescale of half an hour) the film score on a budget of £5 and a pickled egg!<br /><br />I can only describe it as one horrific car crash, so awful, you just stare in disbelief, knowing that you should look away and hoping that no one else will catch you looking! Poor Sean Connery, did he desperately need to pay the mortgage for another month?! Dire!\n",
      "\"After the first 5 minutes there is nothing worth watching in this film\" (xnix444).<br /><br />Yes, but even the first 5 minutes are really bad. The intro with the sword seems to be stolen by 'Conan the barbarian' (also 1982), but in quality not even close to it.<br /><br />\"It has possibly the worst score in film history.\" (eightx10)<br /><br />Yes, that is also true. The score is scary!<br /><br />\"The production values are terrible; the writing, nonexistent.\" (yngue)<br /><br />Yes, I agree and have nothing more to say about that. Even \"The Barbarians\" (1987) is a true masterpiece compared to this crap.<br /><br />Rating: 1 of 10.\n",
      "This was is hilariously bad. One of the most ineptly made movies I have ever seen. Sean Connery has one good scene at the beginning, but even it has some really cheezey effects.<br /><br />And the MUSIC. It has possibly the worst score in film history. I heartily recommend this film to all those out there who (like me) respect an unapologetic bad film.\n",
      "Now...can we take any movie seriously, whose awful soundtrack is a boring copy of the HE-MAN cartoons soundtrack? I feel sorry because this movie is NOT one's typical B production...they shot scenes in lavish locations in England, Wales and France, and were thus beyond typical B stuff... However, this is yet another Golan-Globus-Cannon actioner that turns out awful. Barren the barely decent Connery & Cushing, lead actors seem out of a high school rehearsal; O'Keefe stars as not-so-clever low-steroid musclehead. The storyline is interesting, but what you watch on the screen isn't after all... It's supposedly a deeply philosophical quest for the self and what you watch is a Richard Pryor thing. When the second red knight uses the sword, you clearly see it's fake and not a real sword. I won't watch it again.\n",
      "Juvenile fantasy/adventure with an impressive cast of old reliables (Sean Connery, Peter Cushing, Trevor Howard, Lila Kedrova, Douglas Wilmer and Wilfrid Brambell) all operating below-par alongside the resistible - indeed wooden - presence of would-be star Miles O'Keefe (fresh from two similarly low-brow Ator films). Bafflingly, Connery went on to the equally unappetizing and silly HIGHLANDER (1986)...even if, I have to say, that one's something of a guilty pleasure for me!<br /><br />The hairstyles designed for the film give new meaning to the phrase \"bad hair day\"! Besides, the look of the film is pretty cheap (I watched this via MGM's pan-and-scan DVD, which certainly did it no favours); the death-knell is delivered, then, by the inappropriate and ultra-cheesy electronic score! Certainly harmless in itself but overlong and not exactly rewarding in any way; strangely enough, the director had already tackled the story a decade earlier in GAWAIN AND THE GREEN KNIGHT (1973), which is yet another film that I haven't had the opportunity to catch up with since missing out on it on local TV in my childhood...though I can't say that I'm particularly looking forward to it now!\n",
      "Yes, this is a bad movie. Very bad, actually. Most of the script is garbage and it does no justice either to the original Gawain and the Green Knight poem or to Chrétien de Troyes' Ywain (or Owain). However, it's far from being the worst movie ever made, and latent somewhere in the badness there is at least an acceptable adventure film. Or might be.<br /><br />I mean, the film looks pretty good (it was shot by Freddie Young) and benefits from the use of real castles instead of fake-looking sets. And Connery's Green Knight is quite a sight. His costume has received a lot of scorn, yet I find it impressive. Sir Sean is aware of being in a bad movie and just has fun with his supervillain part (remember when he used to do so instead of his non-acting nowadays?), which is the best role in the film, and transmits said fun to the audience.<br /><br />I wish director Stephen Weeks would take back and recut the film. He'd have a lot of work to do, yet he could come up with something decent (apparently a lot of footage was cut, maybe part of it is worthwhile, maybe not). I would actually like Mr. Weeks to read this comment and think about it, maybe for a future DVD edition to replace the indefensible MGM Pan and Scan botch job from 2004 (If anyone reading this can contact Mr. Weeks, please feel free to pass these lines to him). Here's a list of what should be cut:<br /><br />-As much silliness as possible. That awful, childish and really unfunny humor is what really sinks the movie and turns it into a retarded cousin of \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\". Gone should be the toilet jokes, the goofy fights, the \"Don't you see I'm playing\" moment with Rhys-Davies, the inept sidekick who kills the wrong knight... You get the idea.<br /><br />-All scenes featuring Morgan La Fay. Not only the character serves no purpose in the story, but she looks terribly anachronistic (notice the painted fingernails, not to mention her circus tent) and her scene with Connery makes the Green Knight appear less majestic, less supernatural and less powerful. And her toad form is just ridiculous. Get rid of all that and make the fight against the Black Knight the first of Gawain's adventures.<br /><br />-The fight scene with the Black Knight's empty armor. Hey, it's 2005 now, there's no longer need to shamelessly rip \"The Empire Strikes Back\" off, is there? Plus, it features the aforementioned toad.<br /><br />-The epilogue. It was the most \"huh?\" coda ever to a film until the live-action \"Dungeons & Dragons\" (a movie that, unlike this one, has absolutely zero redeeming features) came along.<br /><br />-There's nothing to do about the casting of Miles O'Keeffe as Gawain or his pathetic wig, but at least a couple of shots where he makes an awful ape-like face (one of them during the fight against Ronald Lacey) should disappear.<br /><br />-Contrary to popular opinion, I do like parts of the music score (particularly the main theme and the one in the scene where Gawain re-encounters Linet, which gets reprised at the end of the closing credits). However, I do think it should be re-orchestrated, to make it sound less computerized and low-budget, and add spectacularity to the images. Still, it's better than your average James Horner...<br /><br />I realize that the excision of these elements would not make a masterpiece out of this baby. Yet, complete with the possible reinsertion of any worthwhile cut scenes that could exist, it might become an entertaining adventure movie with good pacing (which currently, at 102 minutes, it totally lacks), not boring, not intelligence-insultingly silly, and worth watching for any medieval buffs such as myself. Unfortunately, in its current form, yes, it pretty much sucks. 3/10.\n",
      "When visiting my grandmothers house on a Sunday afternoon i'm normally susceptible to all sorts of tripe that pass as Sunday Afternoon Family Films. Today I was treated to this, but Sean Connery is in it, it can't be that bad can it? Yes it can. This is far and away the worst film i've ever seen. The acting is horribly bad, but not in a funny way. It's beyond laughter. The concepts are completely implausible and the whole thing is just horrible. I don't know why Connery was involved in this but I bet he wishes he wasn't.\n",
      "This is hilariously bad,which is some sort of reason to bother seeing it.The charisma free O'Keefe struggles to play an Arthurian knight, Sir Gawain, but no more so than the rest of a distinguished cast, including Sean Connery as the Green Knight.Connery looks embarrassed throughout, as well he might. It is a mishmash of Arthurian legend, medieval history and myth quite lavishly shot, but the giveaway is the producers - the Golem Brothers, makers of more cinematic rubbish than probably anybody else in the history of cinema, providers of homes for actors on the slide. Connery's career was in one of its troughs at the time. The miracle is he climbed out of it to become the sexiest man in the world. Not even Michael Caine could have made a worse career choice.\n",
      "Poor costuming,<br /><br />Bad acting,<br /><br />Some OK sets,<br /><br />and Lame plot.<br /><br />Not representative of the Rennaissance in it's lack of accuracy.<br /><br />The fantasy portion can't even begin to pull you into the story. Bad wig on Gawain. <br /><br />Overall the worst movie I have seen in a very long time.<br /><br />All I can say is Sean Connery must have needed money very badly to act (if you can call it that) in this monstrosity. Don't waste your time!\n",
      "I have seen a lot of bad movies. One of my favorite pasttimes is watching bombs and making fun of them. This film, however, surpasses almost every one in terms of confusion and all-around ambiguity.<br /><br />Having read the classic epic poem \"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight,\" I know that there is a plot to the story. However, watching this atrocity--I hardly dare to call it a \"film\"--you wouldn't be able to tell. The desperate stab at entertainment makes infinitely less sense than the plot of 1998's \"The Avengers\" (another waste of Connery's talent), and is so painful to experience that even I, a veteran of the worst of the worst, almost succumbed to the urge to throw a lamp through my TV screen. I kept watching in the vain hope that there would be a point to the random events I was witnessing.<br /><br />There wasn't.<br /><br />The lead (I think he was intended to be romantic, but failed) is wearing one of the worst wigs I have ever seen, and does absolutely nothing that makes sense. There is a love interest, who follows the tradition of \"Blade Runner\" by turning into a bird and flying away. The production values are terrible; the writing, nonexistent. It strays so far from the original literature that I still have difficulty connecting the two in my mind.<br /><br />The only redeeming factor is Connery's presence; unfortunately, he is on-screen for only a few minutes at the beginning and end of the film (kind of like Charlton Heston in \"Beneath the Planet of the Apes\"), and is given no passable material with which to work.<br /><br />As much as I adore Sean Connery as an actor, I can't help but wonder why he hasn't shot the agent who is responsible for putting him in some of these roles. Of all the bad apples of his distinguished career, this is by far the most rotten. If you value your brain cells, avoid it.\n",
      "This movie is perhaps even more campy than \"Conan the Barbarian\" but it's also a lot worse.<br /><br />For an adventure movie it's way too boring. The action and sword-fights look pretty lame and poorly edited. On top of that, there are simply too few action moments within the movie.<br /><br />You can never get yourself to care for any of the characters. Characters just come and go in this movie. Way too many. There is no consistency in the story. Every character is in it for like 5 minutes and than disappears out of the story again and the next character get introduced. This is a sort of approach that is common for adventure movies but in this case they simple just overdid it.<br /><br />The story is very simple. The way the story progresses is just incredible bad and disjointed. It doesn't care that it just doesn't make much sense. The story heavily relies on its adventurous/traveling elements but those moments are done so incredibly bad in the movie, that the entire movie becomes a bad one, that at times is a real drag and annoying one to watch. The movie tries to conceal how bad it is by putting in humor, to make this seem like a comedy but it doesn't fool me, or prevents me from seeing how incredibly bad this movie is made and constructed.<br /><br />Amazing that so many well known, respected actors agreed to make an appearance in this movie. I'll admit, the only reason that I ever wanted to see this movie was because it featured Peter Cushing in one of his last film roles. Besides Peter Cushing, the movie also features Sean Connery with glitters, Trevor Howard, Ronald Lacey and John Rhys-Davies. Hope they still enjoyed themselves. I surely didn't enjoyed them!<br /><br />The movie is good looking in a campy sort of way, with simple looking sets and costumes. The atmosphere is made even more campy by the horrible '80's synthesizer music. My head nearly exploded! Also Miles O'Keeffe performance make this a campy one. Apparently his voice got even dubbed by Peter Firth. Perhaps to conceal his bad delivery of lines? O'Keeffe is best know for playing Tarzan in the huge flop \"Tarzan, the Ape Man\", with Bo Derek.<br /><br />A really bad movie in its sort and simply not worth watching.<br /><br />3/10\n",
      "So, imagine you are handed a terrific story idea--a 14th century Middle English masterpiece which has stimulated numerous translations into modern English. What would you do next? In this case, the decision was made to completely ignore the original story, to completely ignore the original's aesthetic coherence that continues to invite translation and literary adaptation, and, for that matter, to completely ignore the idea that movie goers generally like to see something movie-like. A thousand chimpanzees with typewriters could have done better in two weeks time than Weeks and crew have done here. <br /><br />This film is a crime against cinema. Absolutely unwatchable. Perhaps actionable.<br /><br />Questions: (1) why is there no Mystery Science Theatre episode based on this film? Too easy? (2) Why, apart from another film by Weeks in the 1970s, have there been no other cinematic adaptations of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight? Or have there been such films?\n",
      "Regular readers of my review list will already know that I am a great fan of the slasher genre. For the past thirteen years, I have thoroughly enjoyed hunting down the many rarities that the cycle has to offer and then sharing my opinions with other collectors across the globe. I personally was not over impressed with Wes Craven's Scream trilogy, but I must admit that I have paid close attention to the overwhelming effect that the three movies have had on horror cinema. Just like being transported back to the glory years of the early eighties, video-stores have once again been over-populated with masked killers and screaming teens. After John Carpenter's Halloween kicked off the boom years two decades earlier, the majority of the bandwagon jumping genre entries were American, British or Italian productions. But this time around we have witnessed slashers from as far and wide as Germany (Flashback), Thailand (303 Fear Faith Revenge), Korea (The Record) and even India (Sssshhh). This was the first of two Swedish entries that were released in the same year.<br /><br />Director Martin Munthe launches Camp Slaughter with an intriguing text that leads us to believe that the events we are about to witness are based upon a true account. Well it worked for the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, so why not? Next up we meet Constance (Karen Bertling), a middle aged woman who blames her husband for the fact that he never gave her the blonde-haired blue-eyed daughter that she so desperately craved. Instead the couple ended up with a rather dopey looking son called Adrian (Christian Magdu). They say that if at first you don't succeed then try again, and try again she certainly did. Only this time she swapped partners and tried with her own son! Constance's dream to have a blonde-haired and blue-eyed daughter was not fulfilled after her incestrial efforts and instead she was blessed with a hulking maniac that she decided to keep padlocked in an underground chamber for the rest of his life. Twenty five years down the line and we learn that (unsurprisingly) a remote woodland retreat has been built within walking distance of the madman's underground lair. Cue six dumb teens, plenty of beer and a broken padlock and away we go on a murder marathon! <br /><br />Camp Slaughter was critically ripped to shreds upon release and most of the unenthusiastic reviews that I've read came from Swedish authors. I was expecting something as bad as The Night Devides the Day or Carnage Road after reading so much negativity. The major critical point from the aforementioned scribes was that the cast struggle with speaking English, instead of their native language. I am fluent in Polish, Russian and English; but under the extreme pressure of trying to deliver a convincing dramatic display, I must admit that I'd feel much more confident speaking in my native Spanish tongue. That's why I guess it's somewhat unfair to criticise such a young cast on the quality of their performances. In this day and age, the majority of cinema fans don't have a problem with subtitled features, and perhaps that's something that the producers should keep in mind for future reference. But the biggest problem with Slaughter is Munthe's pedestrian direction. The movie seems to take an eternity to pick up the pace and then when things finally kick off, the shocks always feel somewhat half-hearted. The maniac is portrayed as a retarded bogeyman and he only kills the kids if he inadvertently bumps into them whilst wandering through the woodland. This immediately cuts out the suspense that's usually conveyed in stalking scenes, which only seemed to slow things down even more. It reminded me a lot of that other pathetic Swedish slasher Blodaren.<br /><br />Screenwriter Alina Warne made some of the most bizarre decisions that I've ever witnessed in slasher cinema. Her peculiar obsession with bunnies (unfortunately not the playboy kind) makes very little sense, and she even went as far as to call the killer Bunnyman? There's one point in the runtime where Constance begins singing (about pretty bunnies, naturally), and for a moment I had to double-check that this wasn't the first slasher musical. Even though its obvious that Warne knew the slasher guidelines inside out, she still breaks one of the most essential traditions of the cycle. Trudy (Erica Earlson) spends the majority of the movie without drinking, smoking and she turns down constant sexual advances from one of the randy guys. So we have an untarnished virgin amongst the group, surely she's got to be the final girl? Well strangely enough she won't be turning up for the sequel. It was quite a shock that she was murdered, especially when every other cliché in the rulebook had been underlined and dotted. Some of the dialogue is also hilariously inept at best and the feature was in places poorly scripted. <br /><br />Camp Slaughter has become impossibly rare outside Sweden already and it's only one year and a few months old. I was somewhat surprised then when I read that a sequel is in the pipeline, which must mean that this wasn't as unsuccessful as many would have you believe. I for one don't think that Munthe's slasher opus is as bad as its hideous reputation makes it sound. Unlike many of its cousins, it's competently lighted and beautifully photographed and it has the odd moment of credibility. In fact there's a couple of neat touches on display and as long as the director cuts out the mundane tekno soundtrack and learns from his previous mistakes, Camp Slaughter 2 could be a contender. But for the moment if you must see a Swedish slasher then get Drowning Ghost instead.\n",
      "Story: A bunch of teenagers go to a camp and get killed. According to the people who made this film, it's a celebration to low budget horror movies, especially Friday the 13th. I love those movies, but I truly hate this one.<br /><br />Camp Slaughter has nothing of what once made the Friday the 13th movies great. 20 years later, the special effects are even worse, truly terrible. The acting never was a major factor for the success of Friday movies, but compared to the acting in Camp Slaughter, the whole crew should have gotten Academy awards. Neither does Camp Slaughter have any of the kind of self ironic humour that always where present in the older low budget movies. And worst of all: it has no originality what so ever. Everything in Camp Slaughter has not only been done before, it has been done much much better before. In fact: it has never been done worse. Camp Slaughter is not a celebration to Friday the 13th. It's a rip off that, if anything, gives the whole genre of low budget horror movies a bad name.<br /><br />And no, it's not even so bad it's good. It's just so bad it's almost unbearable <br /><br />Before seeing Camp Slaughter I had only given one movie the worst grade ever, a 1 out of 10. After seeing this, I'm actually considering upgrading the other movie, because I'm not sure there is another movie that completely lacks every quality in the way Camp Slaughter does. A movie couldn't possible be more pointless and boring. <br /><br />So terrible it's below the scale. Avoid at all costs.\n",
      "This movie is quite possibly one of the worst to ever make it out of an editing room. It has nothing, lousy camera work (I think I found three shots that had some form of focus, no color correction anywhere... a complete mess), an even worse script and no acting whatsoever (and why, oh why did they do it in English?).<br /><br />I can try to find anything positive about this movie... and still fail utterly. Not even as a joke would this work. I've seen the pre-release of another Swedish b-horror called \"The Unknown\". It was made with 1/10 the budget, but is way way superior to this one in all aspects.<br /><br />To put this short: NO, do NOT see this movie. No matter what you expect, you WILL be disappointed.\n",
      "This movie is the worst horror movie i've ever seen. Everything sucks; the actors, the plot, the lines, EVERYTHING!<br /><br />By the way, this is a Swedish movie, with Swedish actors, but they all speak English, and it sounds terrible... their grammar isn't exactly 'perfect'. Another thing i have to mention is that you can clearly see a cameraman in a scene where they're driving a car. In the extra-material, they even speak with the cameraman that screwed up the scene.. hmm?<br /><br />If you'r planning to see this movie, don't expect too much, just expect to laugh... a lot!, then everything's gonna be alright. ... but as a comedy, it definitely worth a peek ^^\n",
      "I had hope that this movie would be a good fall back to the 80's genre horror flicks and that is what it attempted to do, all be it very poorly. This movie was very bad, and bad in a very very bad way not a way in which you want to watch it and laugh at it bad. The biggest problem of this movie is that it is a Swedish film with Swedish actors speaking English. I feel that if this movie was in Swedish the actors probably would have been more comfortable in their roles. Instead it felt like they were trying to remember their lines instead of getting into their parts. I would like to see this movie again in Swedish and preferably with a new soundtrack, the idea is there but the actors are having to work way to hard to remember their lines.\n",
      "There simply are no spoilers in this \"movie\". Although the picture and sound is good for being produced for a B-horror film, the rest of it is poor acting and scenes you've seen in at least 50 movies before. To make things even worse, someone had the idea that Swedish kids speaking English was a great idea, probably so the movie would have a chance of getting shown in other countries!<br /><br />Here's the plot: A crazy lady has a son together with her own son(!) which is then being kept in a hole in the woods. Of course, this monster of a son escapes, and of course there's teenagers in the woods (sounds familiar?). You don't need a diploma to figure out that Bunny-man (that's what he's called in the end credits) will go Jason on the teenagers, but i guess that's what horror-flicks like this should be all about. The problem is that not once do you get scared, not a single scene looks real, and all acting is terrible. In the end, all you do is sit there and get angry at yourself for watching this, maybe, just maybe, you'll have a laugh at the poor acting, or the strange unreal scenes (There's one car scene that made me laugh like crazy, cause it's so unbelievably unrealistic)<br /><br />Watch it, don't watch it, that's up to you, i'd rather rent any part of the Friday the 13th-flicks and watch it again. I'm stealing my last comment from Comic book guy in the Simpsons: Worst movie EVER!\n",
      "Nobody likes a bad movie, but sometimes you come across one that is so extremely bad it actually becomes enjoyable. This is the case with Camp Slaughter.<br /><br />Director Martin Munthe's idea of paying homage to his favorite slasher films (Friday the 13th) is by making one that is even worse. The so called effects were outdated even twenty years ago, and the story is a joke. However, you may not notice this since you are so busy laughing at the actors. Not only do they read their lines in the worst form of Swenglish, there's also an embarrassing lack of devotion and experience.<br /><br />You just have to watch this.\n",
      "I'm the kind of person who quite often rents movies i know i won't like, just because laughing at bad movies can be almost as much fun as seeing something i really appreciate. Sometimes this tactic goes terribly wrong however and the rented film proves to be too bad even for laughs...<br /><br />Camp slaughter is a story about a few kids who go out to a cabin in the woods to party (although mostly it just seems they want to whine and complain at each other). Of course since this is a murder story bad things happen. Soon enough the kids are being murdered one after one by the ruthless monster \"The Bunny Man\".<br /><br />This sucks. It stinks. It's terrible in every imaginable way. It's bad, and not bad in a good way. Basically what we seem to have here is a couple of friends taking their DV-camera out into the woods filming a murder story. That is fine by me, what i wonder is why they released it to the public! And why on earth it appeared on the big screen (because it did in Sweden a short couple of weeks). The problem here is that everything is too lousy, to the point where it's not even fun anymore. The ambition the filmmakers had seemed to be somewhere along the lines of \"Friday the 13th\". To say they fall short is the understatement of the century. <br /><br />What disturbs me even more is how easy it would have been to make this a lot less horrible. First of all they could have used Swedish instead of English. It's not a good idea to use a language none of the cast is fluent (or even acceptable) in. Their English is terrible and make many scenes laughable although they try to be serious. Also, a serious re-write of the script was needed. A little much-needed comic relief and more of a \"tongue-in-cheek\" approach could really have helped raise this a bit above the 1/10-mark.<br /><br />As it is, this film is unbearable. It is poorly made, horribly acted, terribly scripted. Stay away from this. If you want b-movie fun and something to laugh at there are films more worthy than this terrible outing. I rate it 1/10, simply because there is no lower rating to give.\n",
      "An honest attempt at doing the same thing millions of movies have done before. Not even amusing in its horribleness.<br /><br />It's a familiar story, with extremely familiar characters. Scarily so. There is the fat one, the athletic one, the rebel, the nerdy girl and all of them do exactly what you expect them to while being stalked by an escaped bunny man.<br /><br />It starts off with a somewhat creepy yet overplayed idea of a twisted family...then it just turns to crap. After they find their friends dead, it becomes of dire importance to go back into the house to retrieve a pair of pants and Nikes.<br /><br />It's ridiculous. And the \"acting\"...I got the feeling they were fed lines as things were happening.<br /><br />One girl stabs another (it's not a spoiler because nobody can possibly care enough about the plot to be disappointed when the predictable happens yet again) and apologizes...but she's kind of laughing when she does it.<br /><br />Too many examples. Not even enjoyable as a terrible movie. I wasted my time so you wouldn't have to.<br /><br />Please, don't see this movie.\n",
      "The movie looks like its been taped by some local kids doing a homework for their drama lessons, but even if so.. it would still get F minus as a grade. As the title tells its about some teenage people getting slaughtered. So after watching 1 hour of the movie I found out that it would be more fun to eat my own \"***\".. at least I wouldn't have such an awful aftertaste in my mouth as I had when watching this movie. The people in this movie would never even get a role in a commercial for toilet paper. Don't watch this movie, eat your own ... instead.. I recommend you watch the \"Jason movies instead\". Or why not Freddy vs Jason, Scream.\n",
      "I usually don't give 1 or 2:s to movie because there is always something in a movie thats good, This movie however has nothing good in it. Everything with this movie is horrible, the story, the music, the acting, the jokes(what jokes?) And to top it all the actors don't even know the English language. I really don't get it. Swedes are among the best of the non-English speaking people at English, so why pick people that are as good as a bunch of kindergarden-children. It really sounds terrible, and it also makes the rest of the world think that all swedes suck at English which really isn't the case.<br /><br />I really like watching bad movies because i can laugh at them, But this isn't even funny, in any way. I know it tries to be funny, but fails miserably. like someone already posted, \"its not even so bad its good, its just so bad its unbearable\" I can safely say that this is the worst movie i have ever seen.<br /><br />AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE!! PS: Bunnyman???!?!! What were they thinking? DS\n",
      "You know, during this entire movie i expected everyone to start whipping off their clothes and start making-out. Look, the acting is appalling, trying to ignore it is futile. Things just don't add up, i mean i know its low budget and all, but if a person is repetitively stabbed, there will be at least a little blood on the knife! The acting could have been improved if the actors felt the moment, i felt like screaming it after a while! I'm all for independent movies, but if the movie is as bad as it was, then you shouldn't use such a good looking cover! And also, a psychic ability should have some sort of introduction (but don't worry, its only a 3 second thing that has no follow through, so no plot spoiler here)!\n",
      "May contain spoilers- Starts out very similar to Friday the 13th (flash back to a year when something bad happened at a camp). Very bad acting, low budget (sometimes not a bad thing), horrible music, and even worse plot. <br /><br />I found myself asking if it was a Lion's Gate film because of the the horrible films they have been putting out but to my shock it wasn't. This movie was horrible. Blood color was very off, death scenes totally lame with nothing new to offer. <br /><br />This movie ripped off other films in attempt to appeal to people who like the horror genre of the 80's. Unfortunately it was a total waste of time, DVD's and money. I can't even believe this film was distributed! <br /><br />Really is a very bad, lame movie. No originality except possibly the end- which by the way STINKS! They say the good movies leave you wanting more and this one makes you wish there was never one to begin with.<br /><br />Save yourself and avoid this one.\n",
      "This movie ranks in the worst of the worst. While the fun in slasher films often lies in their inherent stupidity, Camp Slaughter takes it to an entirely new level.<br /><br />The actors must not have shown up for the filming of this movie, and been replaced by extras who had never acted before. They make Junior High drama class drop outs look like Oscar winners.<br /><br />Speaking of Junior High, the script reads like a pre-adolescent's English homework after seeing the major slasher movies. Its a patchwork of movies, borrowing entire scenes and themes, with no regard to their contexts or relevance. Bad dialogue, overblown and unrealistic uses of vice (drugs, sex, alcohol, etc.), no suspense build-up, and an anti-climactic ending. I wouldn't give this script a passing grade at any level.<br /><br />In the end, when it comes to slasher flicks, while Scream proved imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, Camp Slaughter shows that imitation isn't far from ridicule, and this movie can only be summed up with that one word: ridiculous.\n",
      "At the start of the movie, the idea seemed good enough, but as it develops, is just a boring story of an evil child that, when kidnapped by a very nice group of people (who just wants to get some desperate money to get a straight life and don't hurt the little child...blah blah), starts practicing his ''art of doom'' with voices inside their heads and a few spooks leading them to get killed. Sounds familiar?!... I rate it 3/10 for some good acting, but that's it. The story is absolutely predictable and done like 1000 times before, the plot is boring and lame as hell, the subplots for each character are so boring, depressive, and badly explored,that i don't think any actor could do any better with such bad material to work on, the dialogues are lame and foolish, etc. I couldn't see any essence on this movie, is just another empty hole in movie making. My advice is, if u'r interested on the ''anti-christ kid'' stories, there's a bunch of movies out there with the same basics, and quite more watchable.\n",
      "\"Whisper\" began on an interesting note, but began to lose it's \"spark\" about halfway through when it hit me like a ton of bricks that it was simply a compilation of purloined concepts from numerous other horror films - namely \"The Omen\". An ex-con and his girlfriend join up with a pair of criminals to kidnap a lawyer's 8 year-old son and hold him for ransom. They take the kid to some empty campgrounds where they plan to wait out their crime. The kid, however, unleashes some kind of telepathic power on them, playing mind-games and causing \"accidents\". Soon, his captors become the captive since his evil and limitless abilities hold no bounds... This movie contains a familiar and tediously subdued plot with the overly sensitive bad guys, the articulate kid with mind-powers, and a completely predictable \"twist\" ending. There's more plot holes than there are fish in the sea, the characters are all irritating, especially the kid, and there is not an original FRAME in the entire film. I detected hints of \"The Shining\" (snowy area and even a man-chases-boy-with-axe scenario) and, as mentioned, \"The Omen\" - with a scene even stolen straight from \"The Omen 2\" involving a frozen lake. Avoid \"Whisper\" at all costs...\n",
      "This was truly an awful film, towards the middle I was mostly laughing. The plot was infinitely stupid and, as it's been said in the message boards, the script was in desperate need of a thorough rewrite. The characters were not convincing at all in part because they were so oblivious to this kid behaving really strangely right from the beginning (He was never scared! How could they fail to notice that? He looked as if he was on a boring school trip). No one was surprised he could draw like some professional comic book artist or that locked doors didn't stop him.<br /><br />There's something called \"suspension of disbelief\", well, with this film it's not a suspension you needed it's an obliteration. The direction and the actors were OK, nothing outstanding, nothing outrageous. I liked the bird's-eye view of the snowy landscapes (reminiscent of Shining, like a few other things) until they started to get overused.<br /><br />Whisper was like a serious version of Home Alone where Kevin the funny kid was replaced with Damien the satanic kid (from The Omen). A stunt that could have been pulled on South Park but didn't need a movie of its own.\n",
      "The story for WHISPER: kidnappers get more than what they bargain for when they kidnap a kid with psychic/supernatural powers.<br /><br />At the isolated cabin where the kidnappers are hiding him, the evil boy plays with their minds and they start dying one by one.<br /><br />That's it.<br /><br />It's pretty obvious the people involved with this film do not know anything about horror films. The kidnappers are, in my book, scum because kidnapping is not cool at all. IMO, these kidnappers deserve to die. So when the Damien-like child started toying with these criminals, I wasn't terrified or on the edge of my seat. I couldn't care less about what was going to happen to them because, well, they're scum. So, where's the horror element to the story? Exactly. This is NOT a horror film. You need to empathize with the characters' plight in order for the horror elements to work properly. This never happened in the whole super slick film.<br /><br />The kidnappers were all good looking and young, so I guess that's how the director thought viewers would sympathize with these criminals. Oh no, don't kill that beautiful babe. Don't kill that Metrosexual guy with the white belt.<br /><br />Yep, one of the kidnappers actually wears a white belt. How gruff. How much time did the wardrobe department spend on this unintentionally funny detail? Was it an inside joke? I couldn't concentrate on anything else other than the white belt when that character was terrorized on the frozen lake. <br /><br />Okay, enough with the white belt.<br /><br />Obviously influenced by Japanese horror films, WHISPER is more about mood and creating suspense than gore and violence. Think of this as a Japanese version of THE OMEN (there are two death scenes which are identical to those in DAMIEN: OMEN 2). But it even failed at that. As anemic as the story was (no one notices the massive painting in the room?; what are those wolves about anyway?), the main problem was the idea itself. The film could have worked if the writers actually knew something about horror or how to play with guilt vis a vis kidnapping and other human emotions but the drama fell flat. And because the horror never registered, WHISPER was doubly forgettable.<br /><br />In the end, it's just one of the many boneheaded horror films made these days!<br /><br />(Notice the big disparity in the Useful Comments compared to the other reviews. I guess the crew has been logging in and voting not useful! LOL!)\n",
      "Even as a double feature this DVD isn't worth the rental. Both movies were bad with little value. The first one Wiseguys vs zombies was as cheap as they come and somehow got chosen to be on this set with another bad offering Meat For satans Icebox, the second half of the feature. Bad acting in both movies. MFSI looks like it was filmed with home video equipment and had the worst music ever. WVZ had little more to work with but it look better and the music was good in points. Meat had better gore scenes and had nude, but not very pretty ones. I'm just going to stop buying movies from Troma. They are always releasing bad movies and I am surprised they still have fans.\n",
      "A troma movie usually promises gross gags, nasty jokes, and toilet humor throughout but this one only came through on the last one. Obviously the producers of this garbage had nothing to work with.<br /><br />No money. <br /><br />Cheap equipment.<br /><br />A total of three locations.<br /><br />No nudity.<br /><br />And no talent whatsoever.<br /><br />Bad acting and bad zombie makeup killed any chances the crew of this movie had of taking a not-so-bad idea and turning it into something entertaining. <br /><br />It wasn't a total failure tho. Compared to the other movie on the disc, this one looks Oscar worthy. If I HAD to pick something about this movie that made it worthwhile I would have to say that the story had potential to be good. <br /><br />Mafia hit men fighting the undead is an original idea, but the director who also starred spent too much time trying to make hisself look cool, but that is hard to do when you can't act. Terrible horrible excuse for a movie. Shame on you Troma for putting this piece of $#!* out on an unsuspecting public.\n",
      "Honestly, this is without a doubt the worst movie I have ever seen, and I have seen more than my share of stinkers. Seriously, there are lifetime movies with better acting than this. Effects and makeup look like they were done by the people that the Power Rangers production team refused to hire due to lack of talent. The plot is nearly nonexistent (and that's being nice). If you ever made silly home movies with friends on your mom's camera when you were young, it was probably on this level (the only difference being that they had about $50 more to spend than you did). This movie should have remained an inside joke between friends and never seen the light of day. Note: I'm not pretentious, I own and enjoy lots of B movies. I just don't want anyone to waste their money; if, after this, you still feel some strange curiosity to buy and watch this movie, remember that you will never have back the time spent watching this, and will hate yourself for that for the next year at least.\n",
      "A huge Troma nut since I was a kid, (thanks Dad!) I've grown over the years to better understand and appreciate the purpose that Kaufman & Co. stand for. And as always, I eagerly purchased another statement of antithesis from the rebel provocateurs of avant gore skinema, Troma's \"Dogpile 95 Vol. 1\". Call it totally crappy. Call it too extreme for the mainstream crowd. Call it anything but stupid. Because this is truly independent cinema at work! Although the double feature's selections are about as \"Indie\" as you'll likely find. \"Wiseguys vs. Zombies\", at least in my opinion, really isn't much aside from a statement. With home-brew indie films, I feel the budgetary constraints and lack of resources that come along with the territory should be made up for with a really good story or at least entertaining acting. Unfortunately, WVZ lacks it all.<br /><br />If you're able to get along with the acting, homemade gore, and home movie quality, there's still not much of a story or funny acting to be found. There are some chuckle-worthy moments in a pretty much watchable film. But overall it just doesn't leave much of a good impression outside of the whole \"fight for truly independent cinema\" mood set by the release.<br /><br />I would never recommend it to anyone outside of a good example for what YOU can do at home if you really want to. (Which is pretty well the point.) But as a movie, \"Wiseguys vs. Zombies\" is just kind of a dud. I hope they had fun making it though.\n",
      "Lets go to japan and hang around in different parts of the hotel.<br /><br />Then lets go out to the street and see, \"whoa, this is different from America\"!<br /><br />People don't talk English! Signs are not in English! People sing karaoke! People eat different food than in America!<br /><br />OK, lets go back to hotel room, and talk about our relationship that has lasted two days, and if we should go back to America. After all, that's where the family is.<br /><br />I decided, we are going back to America, it is a better place after all.<br /><br />This trip to japan was very educating, the view from my hotel room was great.\n",
      "Wow. Kind of a 'cute' movie, riding on that independent film vibe of the individual's search of meaning in life, struggling mightily against an ignorant and heavily cynical world. Sounds like a downer? Never fear, this movie spends 85 percent of the time making fun of japanese people.<br /><br />If these were scathing attacks, perhaps this movie could almost pass as parody, making fun of stereotypes by overkill is quite effective. Except these were literally, 'let's make fun of the Japanese as bizarre little benign aliens who want to become like us.' This is about two white people trying to have fun in an alien land, shaking their heads at the ridiculous customs of these funny little people, marvelling at how the Japanese could be so different from our own sensible caucasian perspectives. There is no japanese character in this movie who is not grossly caricaturized. Also, whenever Sofia Coppola directed a long lull in the film, hey, insert reocurring joke about height/accents/culture and make the audience laugh, again! There is no such thing as a tired joke in this movie, some jokes are methodically inserted every 15 minutes.<br /><br />Actually, it's really worthwhile to watch Sofia Coppola deftly direct the profoundly subtle relationship between a 21-year-old yale philosophy major and a washed-up 55-year-old actor. Sure...they both...don't like their lives, do like to drink at the bar, eat food (hey at least no more jokes about monkey brains, huh? good thing this wasn't a korean movie), crack jokes about the japanese! The movie should have the tagline, \"How any two white people, no matter how different in age and personality could become soulmates once thrust into this horrible technologically advanced but spiritually backwards world.\" Or \"Peter Pan and Wendy in Captain Hook's Oriental Nevernevernightmare.\" This movie can be metaphorically summarized by how any two people can fall in love on a deserted island, a deserted island full of poisonous snakes, fetid water, quicksand, and erupting volcanoes.<br /><br />I challenge anybody in the world,including any type of funny little aliens, to logically prove that the particular setting of Japan was necessary to the plot of the movie. Would the relationship between Bill M. and Scarlett J. be any different, if say, it took place in manhattan? Absolutely not, but we wouldn't have the 'comedy' aspect of the movie. And what makes it comedic? Are you laughing at comedy, or are you laughing at the Japanese, these common, stereotypical jokes? I challenge somebody to find any shot in this movie of a japanese person (or perhaps apes in japanese costumes) who isn't acting silly or over the top, as part of a joke, a joke in which the japanese are the being punched by the line.\n",
      "To my mind this is just an average ordinary silly film. The entire film takes place in an hotel. This is just fine but by showing some shots of a Tokyo skyscraper hotel heaven only knows what Ms. Coppola wished to convey. May be she wanted to depict that as people live in high buildings their feelings,emotions become low. A word about the bewildered American in Japan oh no Tokyo. Bill Murray looks utterly lost as if he has not been paid his salary for playing the part in the film. Scarlett is fine but she could have done better. The worst thing about this film is that Japanese people were caricatured. It is as if all the Japanese people use very long sentences even for expressing simplest of ideas. For all those lost souls interested in Japan bashing, please watch Alain Corneau's film \"Stupeur et tremblements\".\n",
      "I was watching this movie and it came to a point where it had dragged on so long that I was anxious for it to be over, so I checked the time and only fifteen minutes had passed since the beginning of the movie. I spent money to rent it so I kept watching it for another 45 minutes...still no plot after an hour. I would say what the movie is about, but I don't know that it's really about anything. It's a conglomeration of pointless scenes that don't make up a story. I was expecting a great film considering it's 8.0 ranking here at imdb, but for the life of me, I can't figure out how one person would think this movie is in any way good, let alone fifteen thousand. This one has apparently done well at the film festivals, so that should be enough of a sign to steer clear of it. Indie movies are indie for a reason...they suck. This is a great one to rent if you struggle with insomnia.\n",
      "Imagine hearing the major critics on the top of the roof on the skycraper sing boisterous praise for one of the five hundred 'qualified masterpieces', and Lost in Translation somehow received the honor bestowed on Sofia Coppola and company. Big mistake.<br /><br />Lost in Translation is one of these movies that at first you might be seeing a terrific movie, but as it progress it become drab, droll and tedious without justification in substance. There's really no story to speak of -- only paper-thin basic with inanely banterous dialogue.<br /><br />There may be a merit in cinematography that raise the artistic value of this movie, but because the story is non-existent and the characters utterly unsympathetic & boring to watch, cinematography -- stationary in some scenes and moving in others -- somehow negate the enjoyability of the movie by focusing on the ludicrous aspect of tedium as if Sofia could bring back the element of silence inspired by silent films of the early 20th century.<br /><br />Lost in Translation (er, Sofia) abuse the silence element as the expression of meaning when it really add *nothing* of substance to the aesthetics of the movie, artistic or otherwise. It's utterly meaningless if one does not understand the express purpose of silence at the right moment to convey the humanistic value of life in the hectic and modern world. Sofia is being altruistic to the detriment of the audience when it comes to the vanity of the characters as portrayed Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson which generated zero empathy that makes the movie even less interesting to watch in a continuous manner without becoming fidgety or letting out relaxing yawn. There's nothing of interest what happen to the main characters and why should the audience give a care.<br /><br />Sofia made the blunders in filming and keeping the scenes from the fate of being tossed into the cutting room trash bin that are particularly unintentionally humorous in being unabashedly pretentious or idiotically embarrassing. Like the English pronunciation-mangling Japanese hooker in the hotel room and the pointless, unromantic conversations with Bill & Scarlett characters who somehow fall in love while possessing ice-cold personalities that would make Mr. Freeze blush in humbled shame. And the movie moves in the glacial pace that makes it atrocious to watch -- it is the cinematic exercise in tedium for the sake of artistic expression, without tightening up. It drags on and on until the audience feel nothing but contempt for the characters and especially the screenwriter/director responsible for torture by mean of boring the audience to death.<br /><br />Sofia once mentioned her favorite movie director is Terrence Malick. Mr. Malick is a completely different filmmaker who knows how to convey the meaning of silence in the poetic setting because Malick has experience observing nature and human qualities as a former philosophy professor & translator. Sofia did not because she doesn't get the aesthetics combined with silence without the backbone of a rich story and characterization. The Virgin Suicides, Sofia's debut movie, is well-made and competent, but Lost in Translation is such a trainwreck in terms of lackluster substance & poor, drag-on editing that lend to experiencing boredom. This boredom probably reflect the period of boredom at certain points of her life, and she parlay that experience as a form of torture to inflict the mental anguish of tedium on the audience in vengeance. <br /><br />Scarlett Johannson and Bill Murrey, while accomplished movie actors in their right, do the barest minimum except mug to the camera in the aura of exulting \"Sundance Film Festival\" self-importance that elevate this movie to the new level (more like bottom 100) in high art, with moronically sedate monotony & meandering tedium thrown in. Bill's acting is nothing special save comedy and Scarlett is moderately competent but technically bad in dramatic acting (which makes it a safe bet she'll never be nominated for Best Actress Oscar in her lifetime, UK's BAFTA Best Actress award clinch for subpar, vacant, minimalist acting style partially blamed on Sofia's tepid, fumbling directional style & a future hard-*** director demanding spectacular acting notwithstanding).<br /><br />Frankly, I do not know how Lost in Translation screenplay appealed to Scarlett and Bill Murray. It may be a character study, but does it delve into humanities, psychology and philosophy? No. It's more like a staid travelogue populated with non-descript characters that say absolutely nothing but dumb banter then fade to the pretty backdrop with the main characters wandering for a few minutes too long. This script won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay for nothing but silence, banter, silence, banter, silence, inaudible whisper, fade to end? When the critics claim the movie have substance that the audience could not spot and decipher and call us stupid for being oblivious, I say the true design of Lost in Translation is that it is an introvertible proof The Emperor's New Clothes carry a valid allegory that apply to Sofia's vapid, utterly worthless filmflam that, next to Corey Haim's 1989 video diary \"Me, Myself & I\", might serve as an ideal audio-visual torture device. Because Sofia wants the audience to experience what she endured, and so we the viewers get the taste of her bitter medicine of a puerile existence, similar to what Vincent Gallo did with the cheerfully self-indulgent \"Buffalo 66\".<br /><br />Zero star out of four\n",
      "I was appalled that Sofia Coppola won an Oscar for her drab screenplay. First of all, the characters were unsympathetic and out of touch with the world. An actor receiving 2 million for a few days work and a directionless Yale student tagging with her photographer boyfriend. I doubt many of us here have the privilege to be bored in the most expensive hotel in Japan.<br /><br />The stylized ennui of the whole pic was so pretentious. Scarletts panty shots and staring at the window didn't elevate or convey any emotion at all. I really had to force myself awake at times when the whole film veered into an extended travelogue or a home movie. I kept on waiting for the nonexistent plot to arrive.<br /><br />Finally, the 'crocodile dundee' style racism showing the Japanese as one dimensional morons or subservient. The prostitute scene was a cheap play for laughs. Much like, most of the Japanese scenes which were the 'look at the wacky Japanese' variety with the help of Bill's snide comments. If Sofia wanted to portray loneliness and isolation, she could have easily done it without the racist undertone.\n",
      "I should preface this review by saying that my husband and I both have advanced degrees, and we see 50+ independent films a year. So filmic subtlety is not lost on us. We drove for an hour through horrendous traffic to see this highly-rated film, yet this is the only movie in 25 years of adult moviegoing that we have ever walked out of. It reminded me of the worst excesses of 60's French New Wave. Long stretches of people staring. Long stretches of silence and monosyllables. More long stretches of loud noise and incomprehensible voices. Short cut-in scenes that advanced the story (what there was of it) and characters not a bit. We get it; we get it--these people are ALIENated. Big deal.<br /><br />Can I care about two people who are supposed to be intelligent, yet they can't think of a thing to do to amuse themselves in one of the world's major cities? Can I believe in a young woman who's supposed to be a recent philosophy graduate of Yale, who can't think of anything to do with her time but stare out the window of her expensive hotel? Can I believe this same young woman came to Tokyo with her working husband, yet seems totally at a loss when he actually leaves to work? Can I believe that someone who is interested in philosophy so much that she majors in it in college can only be happy bar hopping, dancing, smoking weed, and singing karaoke? Can I believe that a faded Hollywood star who is being paid 2 million dollars for a commercial would come to Tokyo absolutely alone, without even an aide of any kind?<br /><br />And most of all, can I call a film that does nothing more than follow these two hapless and uninteresting people around for several days without a trace of drama or art profound?<br /><br />I think not. Don't waste your money. This is one of those rare instances when I can only conclude that there is some vast critical conspiracy to hoodwink the American public. Surprise! The emperor has no clothes.\n",
      "What is it about this turgid piece of rubbish that attracts such high praise? It's long, it's dull, and it goes absolutely nowhere. There are no spoilers in this review - there's nothing to spoil. The story, such as it is, centres on one dull American who meets another. To make this story more interesting, it's set in Tokyo, not the US. Whoopee! The characters are still dull, but they're in an interesting place. This could have converted the movie into something that had a pulse, but unfortunately Ms Coppola sucks the life out of one of the most vibrant cities in the world and reduces it to a caricature. Tokyo deserves better than this - and it's had Godzilla to contend with...\n",
      "I have seen some truly awful films in my life, but this scrapes the bottom of the barrel.<br /><br />It's as if a bunch of film-school try-hards were sent to Japan, without a script, and told to produce the most pointless cinematic experience possible. Partway throught the film, these film-school rejects meet a representative from the Japanese Tourist Board who pays them to insert further meaningless 'postcard' views of Japan.<br /><br />So, what could I learn from this film? - Gee, aren't the Japanese quirky and strange - Gee, isn't it difficult when I am in another country and I can't speak the language - Gee, isn't it strange that I feel alienated when I am in another country and make no effort to genuinely appreciate the culture or people - Gee, even shallow people can 'connect' when they meet other shallow people and decide to have a good whinge.<br /><br />The most insulting part of this whole mess is that it is currently rated, on this website, as the 175th best movie of all time.<br /><br />I weep for humanity.\n",
      "Lost In Translation is a very well-crafted film. Lance Acord's cinematography is nothing short of masterful. The acting from the leads is nuanced, characters memorable. <br /><br />The film's casual racism, however, is deeply regrettable. Almost every scene revels in the throwaway mockery of the Japanese: accents, language, culture, stature: all are subject to a torrent of snide belittling by the film- makers. What's more shocking is that more attention hasn't been called to this. Put another way: if this film was set in Africa and contained similarly juvenile mockery of the populace, there'd doubtless be uproar.<br /><br />All in all, a well-made film severely let down by an unforgivable streak of crass racism.\n",
      "A boring movie about boring people acting bored and being bored and boring the audience. A few good lines in the movie where one might crack a subconscious smile, but not a real smile, certainly not a giggle. There is no action, just Bill Murray playing Bill Murray, moping around Tokyo, boring everybody he meets. Scarlett Johanson sitting around looking bored. This is the worst movie I've seen since Neighbors. Anyone who watches this movie will sit there thinking, hoping, that eventually something will happen, that there will be a laugh, or something, anything, will happen to break the slow motion dragging along, wondering if they should get up and leave now or have faith that maybe something is going to happen, but it never does. If theaters gave refunds when people were dissatisfied with a movie, this turkey would have been dropped like a hot potato the third day out. I have lost all faith in critics. I guess they think this movie was deeeeep.\n",
      "A movie said to be Irish-English-Swedish was enough to make me watch it when it was on TV, but I must say I'm disappointed. The movie starts out in Ireland, Finbar disappears, then half the movie goes by, and then suddenly Finbar decides to phone up his old friend Danny, telling him he's in Sweden. If the movie was half-interesting and believable in the beginning, after Danny goes to Sweden, it becomes decreasingly interesting and believable.<br /><br />The scenery is really nice (even though I personally can't stand being in the north of Sweden because of all the snow and the freezing cold), but lovely nature pictures of it doesn't make up for the complete lack of anything resembling a proper plot. It's far too weak! Why did Danny go all that way and through all that trouble to search for Finbar, when Finbar was a completely selfish prat who no one in their right mind could really care about (let alone the movie audience!) - which we learn from the first 5 minutes of the film? The story's so full of plot holes it could compete with a Swiss cheese!<br /><br />The only good thing about it, apart from the scenery pictures, is the Irish accent, and a chance to recognise some people who were in \"Michael Collins\", plus Lorraine Pilkington (\"Monarch of the Glen\"). That's about it. Sure, you can watch this movie if you've got nothing better to do, but you'd be better off watching something else.\n",
      "Many Irish films have failed because they try to be too commercial - The Courier (attempt at an Irish gangster film), I Went Down (attempt at an Irish Tarantino), the list is elsewhere. The makers of Finbar have obviously learned a lesson from this, and have made a film that is totally un-commercial. The settings are boring (nondescript Dublin housing estate, Sweden). The acting is execrable. The plot is feeble.<br /><br />The main character is trying to find Finbar (after a lot of tiresome teenage angst), but the scintilla of suspense that this search might have evoked is spoiled by the fact that Finbar is an obnoxious bore, and not worth finding. In short, too much Finbar, not enough disappearance.\n",
      "***SPOILERS*** Illogical and over plotted thriller that has so many twists and turns in it that it leaves you lost in the woods halfway into the movie without a compass to help you find your way out. Robbing their own bank four bank employees take off with 10 million dollars in cash but have one of them the crazy and vicious Kendell, Lori Ann Triolo, badly wounded in a shootout with the bank guard.<br /><br />Finding this mansion on their way to the airport, where the four robbers plan to make their getaway, the head hood former bank manager Beckett, Andrew Divoff, decides to spend the night there until the heats off and the rain, which is pouring down like a tropical monsoon, stops. to Becketts and his gangs big surprise they find out that the mansion, which he thought was deserted, has new owners the Sawyers.<br /><br />Moving into the mansion just that afternoon the Saywers Rodney & Jennie, Mario Van Peebles & Holly Robinson, don't know who to call or turn too for help and are quickly overpowered by the hoodlums with their son Malik, Michael J. Pagan, hiding upstairs. Rodney who at first went outside to check the hoods car is startled to find the wounded Kendell in the back seat with a gun pointed to his head.<br /><br />Malik who saw what was happening sneaks downstairs and takes off with the 10 million in stolen cash but later stupidly hides the money in the fire place having the millions, and the only reason that Beckett & Co. kept his parents alive, go up in smoke.The movie gets really nuts when Rodney's friend and local lawyer Pendelton, Hal Lindan, pops in to check if every things all right. Pendelton is secretly told that it isn't, with Rodney using some kind of sign language which should have had he leave and call for help. The big jerk instead of getting help or calling the police on his cellphone after he's allowed to leave by the hoodlums bursts in like he was a member of an AFT assault team and gets himself shot to death for his brainless effort.<br /><br />Playing for time Jennie puts on a Doctor Kildare act in trying to save Kendell's life only to end up killing her because she had no idea of what she was doing, which has her. Kendell's lover Beckett then goes crazy with the two, Annie and Rodney, taking off in the confusion together with the now out of hiding Malik and barricade themselves in an upstairs bedroom.<br /><br />Meanwhile Beckett is slowly going insane hallucinating that he's now the man of the house which makes his two fellow bank robbers Sykes & Henley, Vincent Gale & Dean McKenzie, a wee bit worried about his mental condition. the two start to feel that it would be better to take off with the money, they still don't know that it's been burned to a crisps by the absent-minded Malik, and leave him to flounder around in his own fantasy world.<br /><br />Hard to take ending with the three remaining hoods being knocked out by a falling chandelier with Beckett rushing to the garden thinking that the 10 million is hidden there and getting both his feet caught in a number of bear-traps set all around the house by the mansion's handyman Billy, Josh Holland. It turned out that Billy just happened to be Beckett's lovers, the dead Kendell's, brother!<br /><br />There's so many plot-holes as well as illogic action taken by both the Sawyers and the bank robbers, turned kidnappers, lead by the out of his bird Beckett you need a road map to just follow the story. Even if you want to enjoy and watch the movie \"Killers in the House\" as a decent made-for-TV thriller your brain short-circuits your emotions by not being able to make you overlook the fact that the film, or the people in it, make absolutely no sense at all in what their doing!\n",
      "This movie doesn't require much critique. It was the typical, boring, cliched Hollywood action garbage that litter movie channels these days. The family \"miraculously\" escape death time and time again while the bad guy descends into madness, yadda, yadda. No depth, one dimensional characters. Why is junk like this being funded? It was \"watchable\", but I knew what was coming around each corner. Could we PLEASE get some intellectual movies?<br /><br />3/10\n",
      "I have to agree with the comment above about the rampant illogic. When Mrs. Sawyer conked one crook near the end with a toilet tank cover, she could have finished him off and taken his street-sweeper shotgun. She did neither. I agree also with the comment about the crazy lawyer who tried to be a one-man tactical team. I don't understand how three thugs with semi-automatic pistols would yield to an old man with a bolt action hunting rifle. But, once they did, why didn't Mrs. Sawyer grab the weapons they tossed on the floor and arm herself and her husband? A few talented actors, but a script without a sense of direction, so it was a waste of time.\n",
      "Anyone who knows my opinions knows exactly what I think of Herschell Lewis's films in general. I would have passed on writing any more reviews of them until I and a few friends spent (and I mean \"spent\" in the sense of \"exhausted\", \"used up\", \"wasted\") an evening watching \"The Wizard of Gore\". Naturally, I had seen it before, but my attention was always focused on the extremely inept (yet still revolting) gore effects. Then, one of my friends watching pointed out just how dull the bits in between the gore scene were. Quite true. Even the lead-ins to the supposed shock scenes crept along at a snail's pace, completely dissipating any tension there might have been. It is almost impossible for anyone to pay attention to this film because for most of the film, nothing happens. Then, when the gore scenes come, you haven't been engaged by the film in any way. You really just don't care about what happens next. The Lewis cult people should give it up. Lewis is incompetent as a director and his movies are not innovative - just dull, repulsive little cinematic abortions.\n",
      "This movie was also released under the title, \"The Mad Magician\".<br /><br />The plot is that a cheesy magician named \"Montag\" performs tricks that seem to mutilate female volunteers who then mysteriously die of the very same injuries they suffered on stage. Then for no apparent reason, he steals the bodies and takes them to a mausoleum in the same cemetery...<br /><br />A group of reporters and cops attempt to solve the apparent mystery. Or maybe it's all a dream... In all probability, it is an opportunity to put gross special effects on the screen when the Hayes board went away and the MPAA was still trying to figure itself out.<br /><br />Of course, the special effects are so poor that they are laughable.\n",
      "Although I have read countless accolades for many of the gore films of Hershell Gordon Lewis, I found the \"gore\" in this film to be incredibly stupid. Sure, there was a lot of fake blood--but the gore?! It often consisted of obviously fake mannequin heads and cow guts that just looked nothing like people guts. Perhaps in 1970 people thought this was realistic, but today with improved technology and an increase in the level of gore in films, this and other gore films of Lewis just seem dumb (despite their receiving a plug in the recent film, JUNO). This isn't to say every one of his films was bad...just all but 2 or perhaps 3. 'Genius' is a word way too casually used for Hershell Gordon Lewis. I prefer to use words like 'schlock-meister' or 'wizard of crap'.<br /><br />In this film, a stage magician specializes in gory tricks. He saws women in half or drives spikes in their heads--and yet they are just fine after the trick is complete. Oddly, hours later, they collapse--dead with injuries sustained from the tricks--as the injuries re-appear. The problem for me is that the guts are just stupid looking and the guy starring as the magician (Ray Sager) is a truly awful actor. Sager yells his lines and annunciates in a strange manner--and sports hair that looks like it was colored white using White-Out! This act comes to the attention of a local TV personality and her reporter boyfriend. She wants to book the magician on her show and later he wants to investigate him because all of his stage volunteers keep coming up dead hours later. It all culminates in a TV appearance where he tries to use his evil psychic powers on everyone in the studio AND at home! And, when it ends, the movie actually isn't quite complete. <br /><br />There are lots of mistakes made due to the little-known fact that Lewis is a lemur--this would explain the sloppy direction. Here are a few examples: the woman who collapses dead at a restaurant is still clearly breathing, the newspaper that you see at the 43 minute mark looks nothing like a real paper (the font and style are all wrong) and you can see the different cut and pasted portions peeling off if you pay attention.<br /><br />There is a tiny germ of a good story here but because the entire production is so sloppy and stupid, I can't recommend it to anyone except bad movie fans or those who actually believe that Lewis could direct. I could also see that many see this movie just as misogynistic as it's a film showing contempt for women as you see them hacked to pieces. But, considering how bad and stupid and poorly acted it all is, most who MIGHT be offended might just instead see the whole thing as a waste of time as opposed to something patently offensive.\n",
      "This might have been an excellent short. And it works wonderfully as a fetish movie if seeing young women getting tied up and mutilated is your cup of tea. As a feature movie it's just dire.<br /><br />Unusually for a horror movie, it features a young professional woman in one of the leading roles -- and she doesn't even get raped and mutilated in the first five minutes for being a harlot! She investigates a magician who performs gory tricks in his show, with the same girls he performed his tricks on later dieing accordingly. This repeats itself no less than four times (if I counted correctly), each scene lasting maybe ten minutes and being as linear as train tracks in a desert, until her boyfriend muses: \"All those girls who went on stage in the show died in the same manner later in the evening. Maybe there's a connection?\". His girlfriend is so impressed by his cleverness that she proceeds to fornicate him out of gratitude -- and rightly so. It was the most intelligent moment of the entire movie.<br /><br />I'm not asking for too much, am I, here? I just want to be entertained. For that, I'm willing to forfeit good taste, intelligent plot, competent acting at the door. In the Wizard Of Gore, though, Herschell Gordon Lewis reveals himself as a gore fetishist. The premise of blurring reality and imagination may be interesting, but it's never developed into a story. Fail!\n",
      "* Just to get this out of the way: Just because I give this a low score does NOT mean it isn't an enjoyable movie. It simply means it's inferior to other movies.<br /><br />1970s horror cinema seemed to be in conflict with itself. It's obvious that a lot of horror directors of the time wanted to make serious, mature, realistic, truly terrifying pieces Straw Dogs, Alien, The Exorcist. It's also obvious that a lot of horror directors of the time wanted to make immature, cheesy, ridicules piecesSuspiria, The Omen, The Wizard of Gore. It's almost impossible to believe the two polar opposites could come out of the same decade. But I guess every generation has filmmakers who grow up and those that don't. With all of that said, The Wizard of Gore is the only movie in the latter group that I can actually find pretty cool. It's no masterpiece. I'm not even sure it's even worth a watch, but if you do watch it, it's not that bad.<br /><br />The plot is very creative for a 70s movie, and that threw me off guard. I was planning on typing this section of the review ranting about how unoriginal the movie was, but I can't do that, for which I'm grateful. The first 20 minutes are an absolute blast. However, sadly, after that point the plot takes a predictable average-man-turned-detective turn strait into a pit of boredom. The scenes that were initially pretty cool just turned repetitious and even a little annoying as they replayed over and over again throughout the movie. By the end of the movie, you'll easily start to see that you've just watched a predictable episode of The Twilight Zone, complete with cheesy reversal-of-expectations ending. The acting is laughable, as you probably expected. It's really saddening how such a great premise received such terrible execution.<br /><br />Speaking of executionshow was the gore? Well, first and foremost, the gore effects are some of the worst I've ever personally seen in a 70s movie. People are replaced by obvious mannequins. The blood looks more like ultra-red clown paint than realistic plasma. Guts are represented by what appears to be red and black wads of paper and look about as much like real organs as jelly doughnuts do. The actually amount and intensity of the gore isn't even that special. This is an exploitation film, so, obviously there is going to be a decent amount, but it's nothing compared to today's standards whatsoever. The pretentious losers who call this the goriest movie of all time, or even one of them, really need to watch popular movies. Just because a movie is obscure like this one does not mean it's gory. Just because a movie is popular doesn't mean it's made by weak pansies. In this case, that generalization I just made proves true.<br /><br />But regardless of all that, this is still a decently fun movie. It isn't going to make you throw up, but it will make you laugh, and there's nothing wrong with that. If you're a hardcore horror fan that must see any and all horror films, this isn't going to be the worst you see. If you're just a casual viewer, there is no reason for you to even waste your time here. Go watch a Takashi Miike movielike Gozuand you'll get the same experience, but with a much better story and much better production value. If you want over-the-top gore in similar style, check out Brain Dead. There is just no reason to watch this movie unless you absolutely are forcing yourself to do so.<br /><br />Overall, The Wizard of Gore is fun, but not fun enough. It's gory, but not gory enough. The story is creative, but quickly falls into clichés. I give it credit for trying, and I'm glad I viewed it, but it's no classic. Then again, neither are most of the movies that are labeled such.<br /><br />1/10\n",
      "So the basic premise is a stage illusionist gets girls on stage and basically mangles them, but hey presto there OK at the end. But then they die shortly afterwards with the same wounds that they got during the act. That's about it, oh and there's a 'twist' at the end. I cannot help but compare HGL with Ed Wood. The similarities are all too obvious for all to see. Question is are they trying to be badly made or are they just badly made? I've no idea but I get the feeling HGL knew what he was doing, and through that I feel cheated. It wouldn't have hurt to put a bit more effort in. The gore is there naturally (in fact the title probably refers to HGL rather than the illusionist), but most of it could be created in your own kitchen. There's a whole 'what is reality' thing going on which is never properly addressed, which it should have been if that was his point. I've seen an interview with HGL in which he came across very well, but I think it's more the case of him talking a good movie rather than delivering one. I love low budget movies but this one has no style and the narrative jars at every corner. Will I try another HGL movie? Yeah probably, I'm a sucker for pap and maybe one day I'll get it. A mildly diverting oddity.\n",
      "I like exploitation cinema. I like the cheesy violence and sex, the low quality scripts and no budget direction that comes with the genre. It's fun brainless carnage packed with oddities and quirks used by directors whom while trying to score a buck or two also test the censorship boundaries to their limit and sometimes succeed in making something that really stands out. With that cleared, H.G. Lewis's The Wizard of Gore is a forgettable piece of trash with a sort of interesting concept behind it. It's not about it being bellow the standard grindhouse experience, the splattery violence is indeed present here, no it's about the presentation, specifically about the lack of such.<br /><br />A magician performs tricks. Tricks never before seen, tricks of a gruesome violent nature. In the opening titles he cuts his head with a guillotine, shortly after reemerges fully intact. After a short introduction and a few minor tricks he chooses a volunteer from the audience, a woman, it's always a woman. Straps her on a bed and then proceeds to cut her in half with a chainsaw. All is done in clear view, and we see everything. He plays with her guts and innards and suddenly, just like that, she is whole again. Returns to her seat and shortly after the show is over dies the same way she was torn in two by the chainsaw.<br /><br />Lovely little idea for a horror and I must admit it was the reason why I chose to watch \"The Wizard of Gore\". The quality of the movie didn't matter much back then as I mentioned already, I like the low-grade cheesy stuff. But the surprise of just how bad that quality is came as complete shock to my senses. It was low, lower than that which I had found entertaining and even lower than that which I found dull. The only possible comparison I can think of is Michael Bay doing a no budget film. There is no dread for horror. There is no cheese for brainless carnage. There is only some of the worst gore effects, camera work, editing and audio captured on celluloid. It's an endless repetition of the same scene with just slight differences. The horrible gore gets even worse, looks laughable with each passing sequence. So absurd as to how Lewis wants you to believe a mannequin stuffed with red paint is a human body. With every minute it becomes more and more unbearable indeed this truly is a torture show. I'll restrain myself from commenting on the horribly annoying acting since that was never an issue worth noting in such type of film.<br /><br />The Wizard of Gore is an amateurish film showcasing horror as bad film-making and in a sense it truly is terrifying. Such a shame because a plot like this deserved something better.\n",
      "Unlike some members of IMDb, I don't reward craptastic movie making with high scores, even if the craptastic film in question turns out to be a masterpiece of pop kitsch. Which is the case here. <br /><br />So Wizard of Gore only gets three stars, mostly for the stomach-churning stage sequences wherein the putative 'Wizard' disembowels, maims and punch-presses his victims to death in front of a live audience, only it's OK because it's all an 'illusion', only it's NOT really OK because the victims all die horribly soon after. It's a compelling concept - murdering women in full view of an audience and getting away with it because the REAL illusion is that they weren't harmed - but it's literally the only thing the movie has going for it. <br /><br />Everything else about the movie is grade Z - from the stiffs who are trying to act to the 3rd grade metaphysics in the scripting to the technical sloppiness and low budget of the sets, costumes, and lighting. <br /><br />In fact, this movie contains the single most memorable 'goof' I've ever seen in a movie: Montag is trying to put a subject (and the audience) into a trance, and he's looking into the camera doing his 'you are getting sleepy' spiel, and he's going along, and then he says (and I am NOT making this up):<br /><br />\"Concentrate.....*c-croncentrate* with every bit of your being....!\"<br /><br />\"Croncentrate\"?!?! Shouldn't the director have done a second take? (Or worse, he did several takes and this is the one they KEPT?!?). Or shouldn't someone have caught this in post production and dubbed a correction? (Of course, I am assuming the movie was actually \"produced\" which clearly was not the case.) Apparently no one (including Lewis) was actually paying attention while the camera was rolling. Or after wards. Geez, even \"The Astounding She Monster\" had better production values than that, and ASM only cost $11.98 to make. <br /><br />I don't want to beat on Lewis too severely (although he WAS partially responsible for \"Monster A Go-Go\" as well). \"2000 Maniacs\" was much better than this (at least for the first half), and his \"Blood\" trilogy was somewhat better. I'd suggest someone who wants to investigate HG Lewis would be better off starting with those films.\n",
      "When this movie appeared in the 1970's poll, I could not avoid laughing. I saw it back then at the local Drive-In with a date. This is classic Drive-In date fare. It is bad, but then, that is part of what taking a date to the Drive-In was about. You didn't want anything too good. It had sufficient scaries and jumpy spots to make it perfect date stuff. In the unlikely event you ever find a copy of this movie, grab your honey, pop some popcorn, turn out the lights and snuggle up on the couch (make sure you are alone in the house). The nostalgia trip with far outshadow the movie.\n",
      "H.G. Lewis tried to top \"Blood Feast\" with this somewhat creative clunker about a magician who saws people in half-- literally. The goopy blood flows freely helping cover the dreadful performances and Lewis's usual incompetent direction. Only interesting as a curio from the era before \"Friday the 13th.\"\n",
      "Hokey story but the ice skating scene is a hoot. Skaters play the old \"cakewalk\" game on ice skates. The actors and stunt men did an incredible job with a simple concept taking pratfalls and sliding across the ice. I've never seen anything like it.<br /><br />The rest of the story is full of cringe-worthy sexist gibberish, but there are some fun moments. Stereotypes abound: the evil newsman, the imperious tycoon, the simpleton stringer. The plot is classic boy-gets-girl, boy-loses-girl, boy-gets-girl-back. \"She's stubborn and he's too proud.\"<br /><br />There's also a fun drinking song (newsmen of course).<br /><br />The actors seem to be theater-trained - they seem to shout like they're afraid the mike in the last row won't hear them. But it's still fun.\n",
      "This is an incredibly dull, boring and dumb film, an amalgam of IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT and THE MORE THE MERRIER. Heiress on the lam takes a job in her grandfather's emporium, shadowed by reporter who's wise to her identity, looking for a story. Neither Fredric March nor Virginia Bruce can raise this turkey above a mediocre level. What is wonderful is Patsy Kelly's inspired comic supporting performance (which should have netted an Oscar nom). She's hilarious, especially in her Vibrato scene, demonstrating a vibrating machine. Oddly, the film earned an Oscar nom for Scoring- there was about ten minutes of music in the entire film, underscoring the Main Title and four scenes and none of it was above the mundane. More studio politics, I guess. See this for Patsy Kelly, but for naught else.\n",
      "This film has almost no merit. It is the pseudo-intellectual, senile gibberish of an impotent, burnt-out one-time maybe genius. What some reviewers view as highbrow filmmaking is nothing but a compilation of name dropping (Hannah Ahrendt, Simon Weil, Iris Berry, - if you don't know who they were, so much the better, if you do, you ought to be verly impressed), vicious anti-American tirades so fashionable these days among the French (\"Americans have no past, therefore they borrow others' history\") semi-allusions to historical figures and events. The story (?) itself is incoherent and incomprehensible, the characters repulsive, full of bellyaching, Weltschmerz, negativity, lack of irony or humor. The only good thing is the stunning black and white photography of the first part of the film.\n",
      "I went to see this movie prompted by critics that placed it up there in the pantheon of masterpieces. Never was I let down this much before! Apart from the on going dialogues that may or may not be profound or interesting, the art of cinema is not really present. I believe good cinema is what makes you want to see a movie again and again even if you do not follow the story/stories. \"Breathless\" is such a movie. This one isn't. When characters seem far more intelligent than those behind the camera we have a failure. It is as if they have escaped the movie-making process and every directors attempt to control his material seems futile.\n",
      "A hilarious skewering of pompous French intellectuals. Godard does a masterful job of presenting this satire without even the slightest wink. The (several) scenes of the tortured artist leafing through a book of empty pages was a laugh riot! I can't wait for the American version!\n",
      "I couldn't make it through the whole thing. It just wasn't worth my time. Maybe one-fourth of the dialogue would have been worth listening to (or reading -- since I don't understand French) if the pseudo-profundity and pseudo-wittiness of the other three-fourths of the film were deleted. Then it could be made into a short maybe 13 or 15 min long and then it might be all right.<br /><br />I don't know why this movie even pretends to utilize actors. Actors are used as narrators of the script and little more. I could swear a whole 20-30 minutes of the film went by showing actors from behind while they talked and from across the street while they walked or sitting in low lighting close up but so that you could not see the expressions on their faces nor their eyes. There was little or no interaction between the actors on the screen except the most superficial for the most part.<br /><br />Some of the lines were as profound (or lame, depending on your viewpoint) as those in Forest \"Life is like a box of chocolates\" Gump. Other pseudo-profundities were simply sad or dumb or poetic (depending again on your viewpoint), but singularly uninspiring.<br /><br />Visually this film is INCREDIBLY boring, especially with the lack of actors. In fact some minutes of this film showed simply a black screen with the white subtitles and French audio. Altogether sophomoric. Don't waste your time.<br /><br />If you like GOOD movies that are stimulating and profound just from listening to conversation while enjoying good actors, check out RICHARD LINKLATER's \"Before Sunset\" -- or make a double feature of it and watch \"Before Sunrise\" first. At least these films are interesting and enjoyable, which is much more than I can say about IN PRAISE OF LOVE (Éloge de l'amour). I give this film 2 out of 10 stars. Not quite offensive enough to rate 1 for \"awful\" (such as \"The Devils\" with Oliver Reed and Vanessa Redgrave). If you still want to watch it, go ahead. But don't say I didn't warn you!!!\n",

      "****possible spoiler***** It's a real challenge to make a movie about a mother and daughter both equally quasi-demented, deluded, and self-absorbed that holds our interest and makes us care about them. And this flick doesn't meet the challenge. I remember a critic saying once that the truest test of film-making is to make us care about the characters. After watching the insufferable antics of these two highly unlikable women for about forty-five minutes I reached the \"why do I care\" stage. I was strongly tempted to press the \"stop\", button, something I have done for a very limited list of truly awful movies, but by then the \"train wreck\" syndrome had set in; i.e. you know, it's a horrible situation but still you can't take your eyes away and you want to see how bad the damage is. I have not seen the original \"Grey Gardens\" documentary done by the Maysles brothers, but it is difficult to avoid thinking of them as two vultures, for salaciously poking into the lives of two women who, like so many others with less famous connections, have fallen into decrepitude, squalor and semi-insanity. If these women had not been related to Jacqueline Kennedy, would the original documentary have been made? But I digress. I did watch all the way to the end and the final \"reconciliation\" scene was to me neither moving nor convincing. Fuggedaboutit.\n",
      "Drew Barrymore & Jessica Lange, two of our better actresses portray two exceedingly selfish, spoiled rich women who through their own stupidity fall on very bad times.<br /><br />If the mother & daughter they portray were not related to Jacqueline Kennedy-Onasis, we probably would probably never have heard of them.<br /><br />There was a documentary made about these two in 1976,which was popular.<br /><br />Why I do not know, except that if I had seen it I would not have seen this very long 104 minute bore from HBO.<br /><br />It won a few Emmy's this year, Ken Howard & Jeane Tripplehorn won for playing the husband & father to the 2 women. Jeanne won for playing Jackie Kennedy-Onasis. Again why I do not know.<br /><br />Both Jessica & Drew play such unlikeable women,why would any one even care what happened to them. Daniel Baldwin plays the lover of Drew.<br /><br />This is a well made film that to me became a big bore, because the 2 main characters were such hateful selfish nasties,I could not care for any of the film.<br /><br />The only decent guys in the movie were the 2 sons & brothers of Big & 'Lil Edie. & they disappear after there scene..<br /><br />HBO missed on this.I just cant figure why this has such a high rating on IMDb<br /><br />Ratings: *1/2* (out of 4); 42 points (out of 100) IMDb 3 (out of 10)\n",
      "I feel a sense of betrayal on behalf of the characters depicted in this movie.<br /><br />I can say Lange did a good job portraying the younger Edith. Lange's portrayal of older Edith, documentary remake, was absolutely terrible with the exception of the \"Tea for Two\" scene. The real Edith, from the original documentary, maintained unique characteristics that were completely foreign and unreal to me. There was a sense of improvised and on the spot personality to the real Edith I saw in the original documentary that was not captured in this \"reinterpretation.\" Barrymore fared much better than Lange in both the documentary imitation and earlier years. Although Edie's encounter with Jackie O was absolutely appalling, disrespectful and unnecessary...not to mention untrue.<br /><br />All Baldwins act the same all the time in anything they're ever in, gross.<br /><br />The documentary portions of this movie that were remade to model the original should have been exactly as they were in the original or completely different. Instead, they took specific scenes, swapped specific words, combined words and made it seem so scripted and dramatic! The Beales are beautiful in the sense of honesty and thinking in the moment, with reasoning behind anything and everything that is done. The movie took this admirable authenticity from the characters into a fantastical over-the-top melodramatic drama that should never have happened.<br /><br />A reissue of the documentary would have been much better than this glossy fantasy that never happened<br /><br />P.S. The word above with spaces between each letter avant-g a r d e is not accepted by IMDb.\n",
      "Long-time fans of the original GREY GARDENS documentary were probably pleased that this \"movie\" treatment of the subject would fill in some gaps in the back story of these two unique denizens of Eastern society -- \"How did they get to this?\" is the question that always comes to mind when watching the Maysles Brothers' astonishing 1975 chronicle. But I doubt that anyone was expecting a movie that spends close to 70% of its running time wallowing in the most boring fictionalized melodrama seen outside of network television in years and which relegates the fading divas of the dilapidated, Gothic ruin we so knew and loved (or hated, as the case may be) to an afterthought. This is the kind of TV movie one would expect to be assigned to the likes of Melissa Joan Hart and Loni Anderson (or, perhaps, Delta Burke!). And maybe the likes of them could have turned this into a fun wallow for 90 minutes or so, upping the camp value considerably.<br /><br />The two lead actresses, of course, are the draw for everyone who watches this movie -- and they are each, to different degrees, disappointing. Collectively, though, they're a disaster. Jessica Lange comes closest, as Big Edie, to a convincing portrayal, since she builds her character from the inside out and doesn't depend on impersonation, but still falls short because she holds back (as has always been her habit as an actress), especially in the later scenes. \"Less is more\" is an invaluable guideline for actors, but sometimes you just have go a little bit more over the top, even toward the grotesque, when it depicts a character more accurately. Drew Barrymore, on the other hand, depends on constructing Little Edie from the outside in, and obviously didn't get to spend enough time in that skin to ever own it. You get to see the gears moving constantly -- Accent! Accent! Accent! -- but you never get to see the force of nature that was the real Little Edie. The biggest problem, of course, is that these two opposite approaches clash in every scene they're in together and the two stars don't appear to be acting in the same movie.<br /><br />The depiction of Al and David Maysles as cardboard cutouts was just appalling, too. That two such walking pieces of cellophane could have come up with a documentary that was so full of passion and truth is incomprehensible.<br /><br />It was fascinating to watch the \"Making of\" featurette that is included on the DVD release, which repeatedly alternates between scenes from the original documentary and scenes from the HBO movie. There were several times when I got lost as to whether I was looking at Jessica Lange or the real Big Edie -- the *demeanour*, especially when she was languishing in bed, was so similar. The same thing never happened with Barrymore and Little Edie. Whenever the real Little Edie appears on screen the energy level shoots up 10-fold. Her cat-like nervous attention, the intense gaze in her beady little eyes, those Kamikaze lurches at the camera -- none of those things were present in Barrymore's performance.<br /><br />I gave the film a rating of three here, just to acknowledge the excellent production values -- the costumes, especially, were spectacular (and unusually accurate in the '40s and '50s scenes). But I'll watch the real Beales of East Hampton a dozen times again before I sit through this travesty a second time.\n",
      "My high expectations and enthusiasm for this movie eroded just like the lifestyle of Big and Little Edie......<br /><br />To begin on a positive note, Kalina Ivanov and her production team deserve all the awards and accolades they can get. The attention to detail, the resurrection of pre-squalor Grey Gardens and period settings is amazing. Kudos to the beautiful costume design too.<br /><br />From there, it's all downhill. Drew Barrymore is embarrassingly bad. Every line she spoke came across as if she had rehearsed it a few hundred times. It removes her spiritually from each scene. She never quite nails the accent, which becomes almost unbearable. There are a few moments where Little Edie comes through, but it's not enough to keep Drew above water. I wish another actress on par with Jessica Lange could have tackled the role. Alas.<br /><br />Jessica Lange was fine as Big Edie. No one else could have done it better, but she too came across as over-rehearsed and sing-song. There are no excuses for her terrible singing.<br /><br />The direction and soundtrack were very \"made for TV movie.\" <br /><br />It's like that disaster of a movie Titanic. It's bad, it could have been so much better, but it's never going to be re-made again. Too bad.<br /><br />Stick with, and cherish, the Maysles documentaries.<br /><br />I may watch this again to soften my stance, perhaps. I'm not going to make it a priority.\n",
      "I admire the acting skills of Drew Barrymore and Jessica Lange, but I was disappointed by the uninteresting story, which I'd sum up as \"Pampered socialite mother and daughter see themselves as victims of the Depression and are too passive to take care of themselves. Lacking servants, they are forced to become self-pitying, smelly cat ladies with an appetite for publicity.\" I wonder if this film would ever have been made if they had not been related to Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy.<br /><br />The Edie's are boring characters with no gumption or insight or curiosity. Even great actors cannot make them interesting, only pitiable. It might have been a dramatic story if they had made an effort to clean up their own squalor or, (horror of horrors!) get jobs like ordinary people and create a new life, instead of waiting to be rescued.<br /><br />The music, costumes and sets were great.\n",
      "What a shame to see two fantastic artists disgraced by their (note to previous commenter: their is possessive; there is a location)participation in this depressingly foul diatribe. What a shame that the last 2 hours can never be regained.<br /><br />Some will say that I hate this because it's a \"Chick Flick\" but I disagree. Only the truly lowest common denominator of women and men will voice their support of this depiction of demented female depravity wallowing in their overabundance of wealth. Why do they call it eccentricity with the wealthy and crazy with the poor? The wealthy have the money to put a different spin on their foolish behavior.<br /><br />Please, someone remind me that Jessica Lange was sexy in King Kong!!\n",
      "While the Iraq War certainly deserves its fair share of scrutiny, and history will surely paint a less than stellar picture of the politics behind the war and those leaders, Republican and Democrat, who led the United States into that war, those who served in it deserve at least the smallest measure of dignity in their portrayal. And filmmakers attempting to portray them owe them a small amount of integrity in their work.<br /><br />Nick Broomfield's film has no such integrity. It misrepresents, lies, and sensationalizes at every turn, creating wholly unrealistic situations, and even making bald faced lies about Marine Corps policies, as well as tactics techniques and procedures (TTPs). The film claims to have used veterans of the United States military, however any of the \"actors\" used in this film who are prior service should be ashamed for participating.<br /><br />It is the Iraq War critic's dream film: where every preconceived notion of what is wrong with the American occupation is true, every injustice levied against our troops by their own government is true, and every hyper-violent, baby killer, traumatized stereotype of the American fighting man is also true. The film describes an endless series of falsehoods before it even reaches the half way point in its run time. A Marine is told he cannot visit a doctor until after he goes home, and then only on his leave. This has never, ever been true. And while there is often peer pressure or doctrinal conditioning, and even sometimes situational factors that prevents Marines from seeking immediate mental help, none would ever be outright denied that help, let alone told that he could not receive it in theater. The film also shows a man clown up by a UAV for simply walking down the street with a shovel. This is also patently against US Rules of Engagement, and would never happen. Broomfield even chooses to sensationalize it more by showing moments before that the man had the shovel to plant a tree at a celebratory party, making the scene all the more despicable to include in the film. Marines are shown threatening prisoners by claiming to hold their families hostage.<br /><br />If there is even the possibility that the events of November 19th 2005 were an atrocity, it can be said with certainty that this film is one. In his rush to capitalize on, and sensationalize, Nick Broomfield abandoned any pretext of credibility, and any sense of integrity. This film is disgusting. Whether you believe the war in Iraq was merely misguided, or you believe it was an outright lie and detestable, this film serves no purpose as a piece of war criticism. One does not have to lie to shown wrong in war. And Nick Broomfield is a liar. He's lucky that he cannot be sued for libel and slander by the Marine Corps. To refer to his film as a docudrama is a sick joke. There is no \"docu\" present here at all. <br /><br />A note to filmmakers: Please, by all means explore criticism of the war in Iraq. It is important for future generations that Americans no longer blindly support military action and not get caught up in surges of war hysteria and revenge driven blood lust. But when you do it, do it honestly, or it makes you even bigger liars than those you seek to condemn.\n",
      "As a former Marine I am deeply offended by this movie. It is nothing but an Anti-American, Anti-Military movie. This movie tries to portray itself as a factually based movie based on actual facts. It is not. Instead it is based completely on lies. All of the Marines have been acquitted of all charges. This movie was designed to make the Marine Corps and the US look stupid. It makes the insurgents look good.<br /><br />I have gladly deployed twice as an infantryman to Iraq. We have done many good things. I can honestly say that as this movie is completely wrong in how it portrays Marines. We don't talk like that, we don't act like that and we sure as hell don't go around shooting innocent civilians. The \"Peace Loving\" Sunni insurgents on the other hand have slaughtered thousands of innocent civilians in the name of Allah. If this was a fair movie it would be 99 minutes of Insurgents killing innocent civilians and 1 minute of us killing insurgents with some innocent civilians getting accidentally killed because the cowards hide behind women and children and use them as shields.<br /><br />This movie is a disgrace. If any of you believe that this is a portrayal of what actually happens you are either foolish or so biased that nothing will change your mind. This movie isn't anything like what happens over there. Insurgents are less than human. They are barbarians while American Soldiers are some of the most honorable people in the world.\n",
      "I put watching this movie off for so long because I basically knew I was going to have mixed feelings about it. This movie means a little more to me (and my family) than most people seeing I am a sibling of someone depicted in the movie. Granted this was just a movie and everyone is entitled to their opinion...it just upset me to see how my sibling was depicted in the film. From knowing my sibling, the director wasn't even close. Pretty sure he would feel the same way if someone depicted one of his family members incorrectly just to make a buck. <br /><br />I find exploiting horrible events to make money disturbing and disgusting. Movie says (synopsis of movie on back of the DVD case) that it was told from different perspectives...I want to know where my sibling and his comrades perspectives were in this movie?! Sigh..some will do anything and everything to make a name for themselves.\n",
      "This is the worst movie I've ever seen! I ve been reading these reviewers who are cediting this movie and none of them seem to be judging the movie itself. They're all giving their own assessment on how they feel about the incident. <br /><br />This film has got nothing to do with a battle of any kind. It is a short story about two al qaeda cooperatives who plant a road side bomb, blow up one American jeep and kill one American! The Americans then take it upon themselves to kill four innocent by-standers who are in the wrong place at the wrong time while the two cooperatives responsible easily get away between two houses, shooting behind their backs as they run. The Marines then go on a rampage, killing the occupants of three houses; women and children, all unarmed of course. And thats it! There is no exchange of gunfire, there is no military strategy. It therefore cannot be considered to be a \"Battle\" and the title, no more than a marketing ploy.<br /><br />The acting is bad, the directing is worse. The filmic conventions of this type of genre are completely ignored; using Blare Whitch stlye photography and relying on video diaries in a vain attempt to acquaint the audience with the characters. If anything this makes the film more unrealistic.<br /><br />If you expect something on the lines \"Black Hawk Down\" then look the other way. There's not enough content in this story to produce something of the same calibre even if the director and writer knew what they were doing and this wasn't a low budget production (which it clearly is).\n",
      "In this review I will attempt to keep my personal political views out of it as much as possible. It's obvious to anyone who knows about the film that it is heavily political and expresses a strong anti-war and anti-US sentiment. Although this sort of thing is nothing new as films like Platoon and Casualties of War have expressed strong political sentiments about another unpopular war  especially anti-American sentiments, the subject matter of this film sets it apart from those and other war films as the events depicted are supposed to be based on real events that took place in Haditha one tragic day in November of 2005 where 15 non combatants were allegedly killed by Marines in retaliation for a marine being killed in a roadside bomb. In the media the event is called \"the Haditha Killings\" or the \"the Haditha Massacre\". Although made to look like a documentary the film is equal parts fact, rumor, speculation and outright fiction. The writer/director Nick Broomfield is famous for his documentaries such as \"Aileen: Life and Death of a Serial Killer\" documenting the life, trial and execution of female serial killer Aileen Wuornos. I've always enjoyed Broomfield's documentaries and the way he breaths humanity into his larger-than-life subjects, especially \"Aileen . . .\" for its unflinching look at an obviously insane woman and the equally insane justice system that is about to execute her. But because of its documentary style, there is a certain amount of dishonesty in \"The Battle for Haditha\" that I find difficult to accept.<br /><br />The film starts off with Marines driving around listening to heavy metal, and then goes into a sequence of 'interviews' in the style of Full Metal Jacket on what the soldiers think of the conflict. It is unanimous that the soldiers don't want to be there, and don't understand why they are fighting. Their training is portrayed as extremely brutal, and meant to encourage violence. \"Kill kill kill!\" is chanted many times. One soldier shows another soldier a war wound that he says could have gotten him discharged with 10% pay, but decided to remain in the service so that he could collect his full pay, even though he apparently hates the war and feels his country is neglecting him. I don't understand this logic; why would one risk their life for low pay in a conflict they didn't believe in for a country they resented, rather than simply take an out when it is offered and go get a job in the civilian world? Even a low paying job you don't like would be better than a low paying one that you don't like that is incredibly dangerous.<br /><br />The most interesting part of the film is the portrayal of the Iraqis. While the Marines are demonized, and so to are the \"foreign Al-Qaeda fighters\", the Iraqis on the other hand are played as innocent victims. We're introduced to a young Iraqi insurgent who by day runs a video store that sells DVDs to US soldiers while leading a double life where together with his uncle (a disgruntled former Iraqi soldier) he smuggles weapons and plants roadside bombs. The uncle is \"pissed off\" by checkpoints, war and the damaged infrastructure of Haditha left by the 2003 invasion. Most of all though he seems angry that when the US disbanded the Iraqi army all he was given was fifty US dollars for his years of service. And so instead he decides to work for another group of foreigners who'll pay him one thousand dollars every time he successfully blows up an American vehicle with a primitive IED. The other characters we're introduced to are a young couple and their child who are on neither side, and are simply trying to live their lives as best they can in the midst of war and chaos. They see the insurgents planting a bomb, but instead of warning the Americans, they tell their Sheik, who tells them to pray. They are afraid that if they tell the Americans what the insurgents are planning that they will be targeted and executed by the insurgents.<br /><br />Ultimately the morality of this film portrays the Americans not only as 'shoot first, ask questions later' types but also as plain bloodthirsty. They march and chant \"kill kill kill\" they sit in their bunks plotting vengeance, they're rude to the Iraqis whose country they have invaded, they don't understand or care about the cause they are fighting for and they blare heavy metal music everywhere they go. In reality American patrols spend far more time handing out food, water, medical supplies and gifts to the Iraqis than they do shooting at anyone. I'm not saying there aren't tragedies happening, and that there aren't soldiers getting out of line, but these are the exceptions. This film tries to portray the exceptions as the rule while ignoring the fact that insurgents routinely and as a matter of policy target civilians in market places and funeral processions. The worst part of this film though is that the tragedy that took place in Haditha is still under investigation, it is only a few years since blood was spilled there. This film presents an explanation and a verdict before the smoke has even cleared, and it stirs up sentiment that will not help end the conflict in Iraq. Even if there is a full US withdrawal from Iraq, the insurgents will still be there. If the US leaves Iraq in the state it is in right now, would the Iraqi people be better off living under a group that routinely slaughters innocent men, women and children as a matter of policy? Not dealing with these kinds of questions is an injustice to everyone involved in the Iraqi conflict. It is compounded by the fact that it is shot in a documentary style in an attempt to present itself as the truth when it is simply, like any other dramatic film: just one point of view.\n",
      "The fact that the maker of this film is used to making documentaries should have ABSOLUTELY NO BEARING on this particular film. As many other comments show, there are a ton of errors. In my opinion, the largest is calling this a \"docudrama\" because it is patently NOT true in almost every aspect. The Marines that this film pretends to portray were acquitted of all charges, but the film doesn't take this into account as it was produced prior to the situation being resolved. It totally ignores this fact and portrays the Marines as sloppy, paranoid hotheads with no organization or training. The Marines should be able to sue this film for slander. It would be one thing if this film were advertised as COMPLETE fiction, but they sell you a bill of goods when they make the claim that it is \"based on actual events\". The only \"actual events\" it is based on is the fact that a war is going on in Iraq and that there is actually a town named Haditha. Beyond that, it is reaching. This is the first film I have ever felt the need to comment on and I am doing so because I was completely offended by the portrayal of the Marines and I want prospective viewers to be aware. I also don't believe anyone involved with this film should make another dime from slandering our service men in this way. To profit from that is completely reprehensible. I have never had the privilege of serving but I know men who have served and men who still do and I pray they never have to bear witness to a movie such as this. These men do an honorable job and to portray them in this light is simply pissing on the freedom that they purchase for us with their blood. To leave any audience with the impression that this chain of events was not only possible but did happen is most irresponsible. I have never seen this man's documentaries and never will. If he is willing to not tell the whole story in this account while claiming it is based on actual events, then I can not trust him to tell the truth in his documentaries. Beyond that, I don't think it's artistic to make a fictional film in this shaky documentary style. Some call it \"raw\". I call it unfinished and shoddily put together. The production of this film could have been handled with a hand-held video camera and entry level editing software. Apparently he put just as little time into production as he put into researching the facts. This film goes to show that in film making, you really can get away with anything.\n",
      "This movie was sh1t. Like most of the crap we see about the war, it's very one sided. Based on facts? Not unless these facts have been proved. You could say that men in black was based on a true story. Doesn't make it true. I seriously doubt this is an accurate plot. Marines are some of the most law abiding people I know. The acting was a little dry from the commanders. I don't mind that though. All these guys would just go on a rampage enacting genocide? No I don't think so. I gave it 3 points only because it looked good. I also liked how the movie made the marines have a prayer after the insane slaughter of civilians who clearly had no weapons. No one even twitched, or thought twice about it rofl. This guy makes Micheal Moore look good. If thats even possible. The brits here have had it so one sided and spewed down their throats by so many \"documentaries\" rofl that don't even try to keep a non-bias, it's no wonder some of the other reviews here think of this movie as non-bias. Very laughable. You have seen one too many Vietnam movies.\n",
      "The film is speculation treated as fact.<br /><br />While horrible things happened and continue to, to lead the viewer to believe this is exactly what happened is simply dishonest.<br /><br />Where was the criticism of the residents?<br /><br />After viewing the film it is obvious the films creator is against the US rebuilding Iraq, and has offered this film to help inflame the situation and promote further bloodshed.<br /><br />A true documentary would have at least had real people from all sides putting their story forward without leading the viewer to the directors point of view only. As it stands we are left not knowing anything about what may have happened, and belittles the fact that people were killed.\n",
      "Look I don't wanna say much about this movie..... Its great,Bachchan is superb....But it is a complete ripoff of Brian De Palma's Scarface....Just check out both and then tell me of there's difference.. A group of bandits are in a village.They kill Bachchcan's father and almost rape his mother. Swearin revenge he starts assassinating the bandits which his mother disapproves. Meanwhile he begins a relationship with a nurse and his sister with Bachchan's bodyguard... I know it doesn't sound same but first see Scarface and tell me if there is a difference.. But its a great movie and Bachchan's performance is awesome.\n",
      "Well what can I say except dreadful. Having been a Bottom fan and Young Ones nut I have to say this is awful. If your expecting laughs a minute like the tv show you sadly wont find it here unlike it's first live installment which remains the best.<br /><br />I'd also like to give some credit to the original tv show director Ed Bye, who was not involved here, that his direction with Rik Mayall and Ade Edmondson was perhaps the key to the success of the series as with The Young Ones, Red Dwarf etc.<br /><br />As for an arse odditty - it's a wonder the audience never got off them and demanded they're money back.<br /><br />I cringed the whole way through the old jokes feeling sorry for the talented two.<br /><br />2/10\n",
      "I doubt this is on the air in America now (2008), but Star World network is touting this as a new show in their \"family friendly\" lineup. It goes way overboard to make every character have a serious hang up about something, and of course there is Jane Curtain's mental illness, oh thats always a great subject to laugh about! They all get together working in a restaurant and there is a lot of awkward moments, in fact the whole show is more soap opera with a load laugh track added to make you think it's funny, but it's just one awkward moment after another with a mentally ill woman thrown in for the gut buster (not!). There was a reason it only aired for 5 episodes, LOL. That may be the best joke this show provided! 4 stars because its in color I guess, I actually would rather a lame show like friends over this and I always turn the channel when Friends comes on, so there ya go.\n",
      "Once again, here an Australian film that is let down utterly by its mediocre screenplay. Why isn't there more funding pumped into developing screenplays in this country? Several more drafts and this script may have turned out okay. As it is, the characters are one-dimensional and under-developed, as is the plot.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I felt the casting was also pretty misguided in The Jammed. Accents were poor and, as a result, it was difficult to suspend disbelief enough to accept the actors as their characters. The actors did a fair job with the material they were given; it wasn't their fault that they were miscast.<br /><br />Really, responsibility all boils down to the writer-director-producer. (Yet again, writer-director -- when are we going to see specialist screenwriters supported in Australia?) Four stars for effort, but it's a pity that more time wasn't spent tightening up the story before production got underway.\n",
      "I don't know why this film picks up 2 these 2 Asian actresses to play the most important roles? because they are Asian looking? Because of low budget? Or may be the producer doesn't care what a real Chinese looks like.<br /><br />Frankly, i don't finish this movie. but If there is something positive to say, it's the Veronica Sywak. She looks very pretty, and did a good job in the movie.<br /><br />Well, this film is made for people, who cannot distinguish Asian countries. I suggest the people who interest in the topic - human traffic, to see the film Trade.\n",
      "Saw the film tonight ans honestly cannot see what all the hype is about. It is not badly made, although it is very cheaply made, but it was just trying too hard to be something it wasn't.<br /><br />I feel casting was what let this film down the most, the main character was utterly unconvincing as an immigrant with her forever changing accent. And the criminals in the film were such your typical stereotypes, no originality whatsoever.<br /><br />Also, the locations used were far too overused, it was plainly obvious that they were just driving around the streets of Richmond and St Kilda as the same landmarks kept popping up. <br /><br />This film is much better suited to network television as a miniseries.\n",
      "OK. Let's start this by saying that I am from Belfast and although I haven't ever lived in a nationalist \"district\" like the one this film tries to portray I am fairly aware of what happens in parts of Belfast. With that out of the way - the acting isn't that bad, Daniel Day-Lewis is pretty good as is Emily Watson except for the occasional dodgy accent the rest get through unscathed. It's not the \"Irish Rocky\" - despite sporting some very striking similarities in the plot, Danny never really fills you with much confidence. But the most offensive thing is the patronising tone of the film. Perhaps I have been put off by the skyline shots of another town that quite obviously isn't Belfast and the look of a film that could have been shot in 1987 not 1997 but the politics was patronising - a boxing match could bring together 2 communities that have been locked in hatred for 30 years? Substituting one sort of violence for another, albeit a much less nasty violence, is the kind of logic that causes these unending wars. Give me a break Sheridan. He also wrote last year's corny Irish-American flick \"In America\". The picture is fairly dark and bleak, this can be the case for people living in fear, but this film skirted round the true issues that confine them there.\n",
      "I didn't have much time for jim sheridan before i saw this movie, after seeing it i had none. This movie is pitiful. The script, direction and acting are simply woefull, it has a perspective of irish politics as viewed from a subway tunnel. it's an absolute howler of a movie with a rather nasty plot straight out of the joesph goebbels school of poltical dishonesty.<br /><br />It's insidious, deceitful and downright dishonest. this movie is an insult to people in belfast and derry. I'd never thought particularly highly of jim sheridan before seeing this but after seeing it i thought even less.\n",
      "After accomplishing masterpieces with \"My Left Foot\" and \"In the Name of the Father\", Jim Sheridan totally went in the wrong direction with \"The Boxer\". I don't think that the issue should be whether one views the IRA positively or negatively (this movie treats them pretty mercilessly). The issue is that, contrary to what this movie portrays, the Irish and English can't agree on things through boxing matches. And they really could have done without all the love stuff.<br /><br />In conclusion, Sheridan, Daniel Day-Lewis and Emily Watson have all done much better than this. I don't know why they felt that they had to do this movie.\n",
      "SPOILER ALERT! A not too bad blaxploitation film with a \"happy ending.\" A reformed prostitute (Diana Sands) attempts to bring a fairly inept pimp down while the cops are on him like glue. Roscoe Orman plays the title role, a pimp who's seen better days, and he's woefully upstaged by his ridiculous outfits. It's all fast paced, sometimes stupid, even a bit campy but also fairly entertaining. Sands brings a lot of class to the film and Thalmus Rasulala is in it too. The faux-funk music is by JJ Johnson, who also contributed to CLEOPATRA JONES & THE FUZZ BROTHERS. Produced, inexplicably, by Zanuck/Brown (a year before they hit pay dirt with JAWS).\n",
      "I've been a movie lover all of my life (which means almost sixty years of loving movies); saying that, I'm also one who tries to find something good to say about nearly every movie I've seen. I even defended such turkeys as \"Ishtar\" and \"Mom and Dad Save the Universe.\" Sorry. No can do, this time around. \"Magorium\" was such a total disappointment, I hardly know where to begin. So instead, let me point out my disappointment by asking a few questions. Just who the heck IS Magorium? We learn almost nothing about him, most importantly, we get no back story as to his connection to the toy shop (most importantly, WHY a toy store.) Same with Natalie Portman's character. How did she get the job at the Emporium? Clearly she loves the shop and it loves her, so why does she suddenly find it so difficult to take over? Moreover, what is Bateman's character all about, and why did NOTHING happen in developing his relationship with Portman? So many more questions --- so little time. You get my drift. Dustin Hoffman is one of the great actors of our time. What a waste. Portman is more than competent, and there were brief flashes of character development. But a few flashes weren't enough. Jason Bateman had so much potential that the script clear didn't cash in on. Okay. Sorry about the rant. I'm so deeply disappointed. I gave up going to see \"Fred Claus\" for this? Especially giving that the movie just stopped. No wrap-up. No ending. It just stopped!!! Wha?\n",
      "99 words or less:<br /><br />Well-intentioned, but the writer/director Zach Helm has no faith in the audience, nor in film as a visual medium. There is no wonder here, only great swells of music where it says in the script. What little he has to say is spoon fed to you by the dialog and the voice-overs. Colorful SFX can't compensate for the walking clichés that replace real characters: Magical Guy. Blocked Artist. Lonely Child. Boring Accountant. Yeah, it's a Kid's Movie. Cap'n Krunch is Kid's Cereal. Does that make it good? <br /><br />I feel better now.\n",
      "This movie is really poor in script, bringing an ancient-over-used formula. Maybe the scene or the actors could save it, but, in fact, it reduced all the crew to a poor B-movie. I'm very sad, because this movie took my money, my time and got me in trouble with my family. I feel like a real dumb. I really like Natalie Portman's work, but in this movie she laugh like an idiot and act like a starter. I really don't get why she submit herself at a movie like that. Dustin is, as always an excellent actor, but c'mon, he didn't need a tittle like this one. The only exception of the crew was the boy, Zach Mills, he really put some color in the picture. My little daughter, 5 years, begun to kick the chair in front of us with 15 minutes from the start and my older, 9 years, got sickness in the middle. Don't watch it... Waste of time, money and others.\n",
      "Pretty bad movie. Lots of hype, no substance. Have to say this is one of the worse yet this year. My 8 and 3 year old never got interested in it at all and they love most all movies. Sad. Feel ripped off and wish I could get money back. Oh well, live and learn. The plot is all over the place. Tries to make some sort of connection between man and girl and it fails. I still don't know what the plot was about actually. Was it about the store being magic? The girl being the reason for magic? The mutant being the helper. I just don't get it. They called an accountant a mutant all through the movie and he seemed to not care being called a name of hate. I just have nothing good to say about this. And I usually can say something good about all movies.\n",
      "What a great concept, a magical toy store. Couple that with an excellent performance by Dustin Hoffman. Unfortunately the positives stop there.<br /><br />This film was horrible written. Conflicts are introduced, plod along and then are never resolved. I'm not talking about leaving something hanging to open the door for a sequel. Several plot lines were just dropped cold. It's as if the writer saw the stacks of pages and said \"Wow, I've to wrap this up now\".<br /><br />The magical toy shop has so much potential but never shines. It could be a character in the story but is just an extra in the background.<br /><br />Portman's character is supposed to conflicted, even coming-of-age but just comes off as whiny. Her worst performance to date.<br /><br />Bateman's character adds little to the story yet receives major screen time. Just as he's being framed as the man who learns to play again, the film ends, unresolved. Did the character learn anything? Has he changed? Or is he just humoring Mills's character? Who knows? And no, this isn't a film where conclusions are left to the audience. It's a bridge built 3/4 across a river than just stops. My nomination for this year's Razzie.\n",
      "One star? Awful? Yes. Please, don't get me wrong, as I am a huge fan of Dustin, Natalie and Jason. But there is nothing these talented actor's could have done to make this mess something watchable. Oh, I know..you think I don't get it. Believe me, I get it..this is film for kids, you will say. Wrong! My 8 and 10 year old kids were BORED stiff..quickly. I was mortified, and I was not expecting Rainman or Willy Wonka.<br /><br />Believe me, I know what whimsical, magical, wonder-mental is. This film is just plain..mental. And you and your kids would have to be that way to enjoy this. This movie would have been good for a Thankgiving or Holiday movie, gone straight to video or even TBS. But no, you have to pay dearly to take three people to see this one.<br /><br />Okay, here is the nicest thing I can say about this movie: Forget it!\n",
      "What? I watched this movie with my two young nephews (8 and 11 years old) and it very nearly put all of us to sleep on a Friday night before the sun went down (8pm). In fact, it put them to bed (they're asleep at 8:10 while I am babysitting with them at my place) - I guess that's \"one\" GOOD thing that came from this movie; it'll knock the kids out fast. This movie was a real bomb (by bomb I mean the original use of the word). We didn't get it at all. The two boys hung in there during the movie; patiently (although there was A LOT of sighing) and I kept thinking...something good Has GOT to happen because Dustin, Natalie & Jason would never haven taken a movie with such a dead beat theme and ending. None of the characters that were introduced were developed very far at all. I am still scratching my head...\n",
      "Welcome to Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium, the strangest, most fantastic, most wonderful toy store in the world. It's a tantalizing toy haven in which everything inside literally comes to life ? including the store itself ? and where marvels of every imaginable, possible kind, and beyond, never cease... that is, until now.<br /><br />When Mr. Magorium (Dustin Hoffman), the store's extraordinary 243 year-old proprietor, announces that he will at long last hand over the reigns of his wonder-expanding store to his unconfident young manager, Molly Mahoney (Natalie Portman), the store decides to throw an unusual tantrum. As a skeptical accountant named Henry (Jason Bateman) comes in to audit the Legos® and Lincoln Logs®, not to mention the Whodathoughts and Whatchamacallits, the once sparkling, color-saturated Emporium is suddenly embattled by mysterious changes. The playful toys are all still there, but they've turned gray and quiet ? and only Mahoney and Henry can revive them if, with the help of a superdexterous 9 year-old (Zach Mills), they can find the source of magic inside themselves. Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium 2/10\n",
      "This movie became a cult classic in Norway, described as one of the worst Norwegian movies ever made, so when I took the courage to watch it, my expectations where already very low. But even so, after I managed to get trough the whole movie I couldn't help but wonder how the actors willingly would humiliate themselves like this? It's not just the thing that it's really boring, and without a story, but it seems like they have tried to compensate with as much kinky sex as possible. This one sex scene lasted for about 7 minutes, no music, nothing but humping. Right... Acward... Fast Forward and... Urinating! Nice... Well if you are into that sort of thing, this movie still wouldn't be anything for you. Even porn have better storyline than this.<br /><br />A solid 1, and come on, don't vote this 10 because both you and I know it's not worth it. The only place this film belongs is in the trash, or on IMDb's bottom 100 list.\n",
      "Fortunately I bought a ticket for this film when it showed in 1988, without knowing anything about it. I say fortunately because otherwise I would have had another film on my \"worst film ever list\". This however beats them all. I remember people leaving continuously during the showing, my friend and I staying on just to see if it could get any worse - which it did. In the end there were 3 or 4 people left. Been a long time now - but if I remember correctly, Amanda asks, after having sliced of the cowboy's penis, \"don't you think he wanted it this way?\". You bet he did... Anything positive about this film? Amanda Ooms is pretty, that's about it.\n",
      "This is truly one of the worst films ever attacking an innocent audience. So stupid you won't believe it. Avoid at all costs. It is useless to tell about all that is wrong with it. Bad directing, stupid script, lousy acting.... you name it.\n",
      "This is a stylish Sherlock Holmes film with the best foggy-London atmosphere I've ever seen on film - just great photography with some wonderful, murky shots. I saw it on VHS and I wouldn't mind seeing it now that it is available on DVD. It has to look really good.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the story doesn't match the cinematography. It just bogs down in too many spots. The script could have used some better editing. It's hard to watch for more than an hour without your mind wandering.<br /><br />Christopher Plummer and James Mason make a good Holmes-Dr. Watson pair, respectively, with good chemistry. I could have done without all the religious exclamations spoken by Mason. A little too much credence is given the \"medium\" (Donald Sutherland) too, but filmmakers have always loved promoting the occult, especially in Britain, land of \"Harry Potter.\" Sutherland's role was minor (but played up by critics, of course.) As another reviewer pointed out here, you'd never see a character like that show himself in a Conan Doyle piece of literature.<br /><br />The ending is typical modern-day film-making in which the government is corrupt and the Free Masons are the bigoted villains. I'll stick with Basiil Rathbone versions of Sherlock Holmes where you don't have all the political agendas and they concentrated on just telling the crime story.\n",
      "I adore Jeremy Brett. I love Basil Rathbone. I like a few of the honorable mentions, especially Rupert Everett. Christopher Plummer, not so much. What they probably told him was a sly grin looks like a smirk to me. And what is with the hair in this movie? The Plummer and Sutherland wigs must be the envy of Trump and Blagojevich, not to mention Gielgud's lower face. It's the small things that gnaw at your cuticles, but when I could tear myself away from the hair, I appreciated the set design, costuming and music. It was beautifully shot and had some refreshing non-Conan Doyle dialog: \"You squashed my pea.\" And what a cast! By the way, the Clark commentary is good. In short, not a favorite movie but not a wasted two hours.\n",
      "I am a big big fan of \"Le fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain\". In fact, it's one of my favorite movies of all time. A friend told me about Odette Toulemonde and since she loves Amélie too, I got the DVD and just watched it.<br /><br />And I am feeling very sorry and most of all disappointed now. While the movie was clearly inspired by Amélie (to say the VERY least!), it never ever gets there. Not even close.<br /><br />The story is totally made up nonsense. It's actually SO made up, the characters are SO two-dimensional and uninteresting, the whole thing is SO senseless and boring it actually started to hurt physically.<br /><br />And while Audrey Tautou is just totally cute and lovable and Amélie Poulain is a multi-faceted, well constructed character, Caterine Frot - sadly - has no comedic talent whatsoever and her character Odette Toulemonde is dull, uninteresting and flat.<br /><br />The acting in general is way beyond terrible, so at least it's not Caterine alone that makes this movie an epic fail in my book. <br /><br />Forgive my rave, but I expected something soooo different - especially since it tries so hard to \"be\" Amélie. I realize, that (reading the other comments) not very much people will agree with me, but nevertheless it's how I feel.<br /><br />And oh, I got a DVD for sale, if you are interested ;-)\n",
      "First the positive sides: Some beautiful pictures/ shots, some funny moments, a lovely actress playing with charme and surely this will put a smile on your face. On the other hand, what comes along as \"funny\" is often rather serious in reality and so in my opinion, the movie wants or tries to be \"lighter\" than it actually is. The jokes can be foreseen (clever is something else!) and are sometimes a little forced, plus there is a lot of cliché, so the genre of \"kitsch\" is perfectly fulfilled. It reminded me a little of the movie \"Amelie\" which I disliked for similar reasons. There is better french humour, charme and \"feel-good-movies\" than this. All in all, this one was a bore to me.\n",
      "Dreck heaped upon dreck and topped with yet more dreck.<br /><br />The lady who plays Supergirl looks like her. But the screenplay is just total cutesy-wutesy cornball dumbness. And Supergirl just sort of ends up being more a naive dingaling instead of being a person from a very highly sophisticated culture. She's portrayed here as a dumb blond maybe slightly more intelligent than a box of rocks, but not by much. In the comics, Kara-El was no dummy, she was a happening gal who gives the baddies a very rough time. You may or may not be able to fool her once, but you'll never fool her twice. But here, Kara-El is so annoyingly dumb, dumb, dumb. She may have been inexperienced in earthly, human ways, but she wouldn't have been that damn stupid. I'm sure that the entire El family, if they were real and had seen this movie, would have sued the movie makers for libel and defamation of the El family.<br /><br />Does anyone but me wonder how it is that Kara-El could automatically speak perfect contemporary American English although it's not likely she would have known a single word of English as she knew next to zilch about Earth as she was portrayed here?<br /><br />Did the movie makers even bother doing any background research by actually reading the comics? Apparently very little if any. I'm a great fan of the stories of the various members of the El family, and this is definitely not the Kara-El i remember reading so many stories about.<br /><br />On the plus side, the actresses playing the baddies were a hoot hamming it up being characters of unremitting egotistical sleazoidness. Without them, this movie would have been a total snoozefest.<br /><br />Basically, i've found movies made of Kal-El and Kara-El to be of extreme disappointment. They've been overly cornball and so humanish. But Kal-El and Kara-El aren't human. They may be people, but they aren't human people. The movies keep portraying them as human, but they aren't at all, no matter what they may look like on the outside. And even if Kal-El grew up in human culture, Kara-El definitely did not. Kara-El was completely Kryptonian, born and bred.<br /><br />The only actor i've seen who could pull off being a Kryptonian superhero was George Reeves. His Superman may have been human-reared, but still very much Kryptonian in his soul. And he had a sense of humor. Who says that aliens can't also have a good-natured sense of humor?<br /><br />Final analysis: This was a chick flick with some of the worst failings that chick flicks tend to have. Like a lack of authenticity and believability. And getting from point A to point C without any defining and explaining point B in between. That effect can manifest without any cause.<br /><br />If i were Kara-El, i would have put my super foot to super kicking some human movie maker butt for making me look like such an idiot.<br /><br />And rather than just whine and complain, i call for a remake, but this time, let's do it right. Do a movie that if Kara-El were real, she would proudly say \"That's me, alright!\" (After she learned to speak English, of course.)\n",
      "i found this movie disappointing.to me,the story had very little depth,and the villain for Supergirl is pretty weak.there is too much mysticism for this type of movie,for my tastes.plus there are some scenes which just feel like filler.the movie is very slow at times,in fact it can be downright boring. Helen Slater is hot for sure,but that doesn't make the movie necessarily good.the Superman movies,at least the first 2,had an epic quality to them.this movie just seems like it was slapped together with very little thought.if you're not gonna have a villain worthy of the hero,then what's the point?that's an element that should be essential in this type of movie.the scope of the movie is just too small.at the end of the movie,there is no real lasting impact.while it wouldn't say this movie is abysmal,it certainly is not very good either.it won't likely be the worst movie you see, but it should have been so much better.the most i can squeeze out for this movie is 4/10\n",
      "I have seen this movie twice. While I agree Slater is Hot and all that. But It took Warners 4 years to recover from the critical and financial bomb that was SuperGirl. SuperMan was the final nail in the coffin for the reeves era Superman. IN 1989, Warners Realised rather late in the day that Rather than have a campy looking guy who wears his jocks outside his SuperSuit people wanted something darker and a hero who beat villains up.. Warners Re-invented a much darker hero called Batman.<br /><br />The Keaton/Burton combination together with Nicholsons demand that he get a gross percentage of the Merchandise of that plus subsequent sequels was a masterstroke and revived not only WB but his own financial clout. Batman Returns made even more money as did Batman Forever and yes even the much reviled Batman and robin. Batman Begins Changed everything.<br /><br />Because it made sense to bring Bruce back to his origins and the switch to Chicago made the film more real somehow. All filmmakers of Superhero movies are all going to do this. Superman Returns will be different in the sense that he returns to earth after being away for an unspecified period of time. They need to consider carefully about what story to give Supergirl.<br /><br />Maybe they may do Smallville on her, have her come to earth as a baby. In Smallville, jor el used someone called Kara to tempt Kal-el in coming home. I don't think there was a connection to supergirl there because she was never mentioned again. Look at how much slagging the aquaman debacle has got over the decision to replace one with another. People Will not go to another Mushy romantic film as SG. To fit into the modern time, they will have to make her tougher, harder and dark. Just like they did with Batman.\n",
      "Spin-off of Superman series from the same producers. The Salkind brothers wished to put the series after the failures of Superman III and IV but this in 1984 when he come out was a great box-office flop. The picture-idea is not bad: it's a superhero-movie with the women lords it: all the principal characters are females and the men are relegated to co-starring or to protagonist's love-interest role. <br /><br />It's the story of beautiful blond young girl Kara from Argo city; a fragment of Krypton planet where the survivals are take refuge after the planet's destruction. Here the live is founded by a powerful sphere called Omegahedron invented by charismatic scientist Zaltar but one day the magical object for error gets lost and was re-sucked in the deep space. Kara takes a spatial device and goes to find of Omegahedron but the powerful object falls in down in the clutches of a evil terrestrial witch called Selena with dreams of world domination. Kara arrives in the earth and becomes immediately Supergirl: the maid of steal: with super-costume red-blue with the big S in the chest and then assumes the secret identity of school-girl Linda Lee and takes lodging in the local college; her roommate is Lois Lane's sister Lucy. The rivalry between Linda Lee/Supergirl and Selena is as for the Omegahedron possess as for same love-interest the muscle-man gardener Etahn. This rivalry remands me to contrast between Snow White and the wicked stepmother because also here the witch hates her arch-nemesis because she's more young and more pretty. In the final climatic battle, the witch evokes the dark powers and stirs up a monster against Supergirl. The maid of steal frees oneself from monster's grasp and wraps Selena in a whirlwind pushing her versus the monster: the witch screams desperately when is devoured by the voracious monster. The good triumphs, the peace returns in Earth and Supergirl takes finally the Omegahedron at Argo and saves her people. <br /><br />Director Jeannot Szworc gives a decent job: the rhythm of the action is not particularly raging but he is able to render the mood, the atmosphere of comic-book perhaps also helped by the photography and the scenography that gives the right color to the images. The music-score by Jerry Goldsmith is really splendid and gives to movie that lot of adventure spirit that have. The real reason of failure is the poor screenplay of David Odell: the history is silly, absurd and truly unbelievable. Sure the difficulty of production not must have helped Odell: at the last minute Cristopher Reeve, that must have been Superman in a little cameo, leaved the project (perhaps because he their have realized the narrowness) and Dolly Parton that was the first choice for the villainies role disowned, judging truly grotesque and silly. Although the problems the screenwriter is guilty for dialogs among the worst in movie history, for a plot full of holes and nonsense but especially he's responsible for a villainess absolutely groundless and dull that represents the real movie's disappointment. <br /><br />The all-star cast is interesting; the 18-old year Helen Slater in the title-role is wonderful; she's very beautiful when she flies with the mini-super costume and she gives to character the right mix of naivety and courage; she's the real perfect choice for the role; it is a pity that the picture's failure have run over her and have ruined her carrier still after to start. Then Slater will have in future only supporting roles in a little not important movies. As Marlon Brando in Superman movie Peter O'Toole shines as Zaltar and is splendidly camp; his hamming was funny and entertaining although the character and the lines are very poor. Peter Cook as the acerbic Dunaway's flame Nigel and Brenda Vaccaro as Selena's sidekick Bianca are campy and sarcastically funny; Hart Bochner as Etahan was embarrassing; he's very attractive but his acting is appalling. Marc McClure as Lucy Lane's boy-friend represents the only character that connects this movie to Superman's series. The rich cast is completed by Mia Farrow and Simon Ward in a little cameo as the Kara's parents. <br /><br />A speech apart merits miss Faye Dunaway as the movie's villainess; she's the evil witch Selena and she's horrible in every sense: her acting is so hammy and over-the-top than in few moments she's very unbearable; the character is unbelievably bad and silly but Dunaway seems to be pleased with herself, she speaks few of the most idiot lines of movie history with a unjustified fanatical gusto. Moreover her appearance is dreadful; it's true that she's a witch but the movie history was rich of witches funny or seductive or regaling or menacing; Dunaway is nothing of all this but she's grotesque, clumsy and with her make-up, with a big wig red-shocking and her bizarre look, she seems a man in drag. Dunaway is a witch and like the true witches, she's really ugly and wicked; in a movie almost all-female her face continually furrowed from grimaces and smirks is horrid to watch. She bears the palm of the worst actress in the movie but especially this time she wins also the award as the most ugly woman in the screen although the presence of the fat Vaccaro. In few scenes this enormous ham female falls in ridicule ruinously: when Dunaway prepares the spell-love potion with a spider and a walnut she's really embarrassing or when tries to seduce Etahn painfully or still in the final battle when she screams clumsily before to become feeding for the monster.<br /><br />This picture was considered one of worst comic-book movies ever but his ugliness it's such as was a sort of cult movie among the bad movies and most of merits are due to the uncontested queen of the razzie awards Faye Dunaway.\n",
      "So very, very awful. You know how sometimes you rent a horrible movie because you expect to be amused by it's awfulness? This movie is the dreaded, actually bad \"bad movie.\"<br /><br />After naif space-blonde Kara (Helen Slater) caresses her orb with something out of the Xandria Collection and ruins her space-city, she takes to the sky in super-crappy looking bowling ball to retrieve it. And lucky earth gets her.<br /><br />The big problem here is they strenuously avoided answering the question: What does a female superhero do in a movie-going culture that prefers it's women inactive, neutral and pretty? It would be difficult to create anything this numbing without having used a lot of drugs in the 70s. Nearly every strange, insipid frame of this inspires the thought, \"This is a profoundly weird movie.\" The utilitarian script delivers functional scene after scene without regard to logic, human psychology, plot or intelligence. It does however excel at placing loud, stupid moments one after another until there's over two hours of crap on the screen; damned if you could offer a reason why.<br /><br />Every frame of this is just objectionable. Slater's voice is weird. Everyone's hair is fried. Kara's dad looks like a lesbian. The Utopian Argo city looks as limp as utopias have looked since Lost Horizon. i.e. \"We're all mellow wussbags, and we all lay around in pajamas.\" The city looks like a mall made out of macramé. Total hippy B.S. The cast is a weird, weird mix. The story is elaborate and incoherent. There are easily 5 characters too many. Everything learned about movie-making in the previous 50 years is forgotten.<br /><br />They didn't get away with it here. But schlock like this paved the way for similarly bloated, stupid movies like Pirates of the Caribbean.<br /><br />Horrid, misshapen... insipid.\n",
      "Outside of this film's seemingly devoted fanbase (not counting the IMDb user obsessed with Siouxsie Sioux who keeps creating new identities and entering positive \"10 star reviews\" in an effort to convince the casual visitor that \"Supergirl\" is a film loved by everybody), \"Supergirl\" seems to have been box-office Kryptonite. Clearly the magic was gone in the franchise after the first two films, and perhaps \"Supergirl\" was seen as a means of taking the same idea in a new direction. It was a branch of the family tree that would have been better left unexplored.<br /><br />Just about the only novel thing about this film is having a female superheroine as its central character, and I suspect it was this identification with young girls that gave \"Supergirl\" most of its audience. Wonder Woman's TV show had already come and gone, and a big-screen female contender was the next logical step. In 1984, it was an idea whose time had come. Unfortunately, it came in the form of this movie.<br /><br />Part of the problem is that it's not very easy to understand exactly what's going on in the film. It's one thing to make the audience think and imagine, but it's quite another to make the audience confused; there are some serious blanks that should have been filled in if the movie were to truly connect. The version I first saw was the original American theatrical print, although even the extended cuts of the film don't help explain much. As the movie opens, we see what appears to be a large crystal shopping mall surrounded by bleak nothingness. We learn this is \"Argo City\", a fragment of the planet Krypton. Somehow it has survived the massive explosion that obliterated the original planet, and furthermore we learn that it exists in \"inner space\" instead of outer space. This is more than a little vague, especially when Kara makes her voyage to Earth in a spaceship, and emerges in a lake.<br /><br />She has come in search of the Omegahedron, a whirling, glowing tennis ball that happens to be one of Argo City's main power sources. Kara has helped lose it, so she must reclaim it before everyone in her city presumably dies. Even with this kind of crucial time constraint, she still has time to do a flying ballet when she arrives on Earth (already in costume). She also feels the need to adopt a secret identity as a student at a local girls school and waste time going to classes.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the Omegahedron has fallen into the wrong hands: Faye Dunaway's. She is an amateur witch named Selena who immediately senses the Omegahedron's power when it literally lands in her soup at a picnic. No, really. Selena intends to use the Omegahedron to achieve all sorts of lofty goals, like making a landscaper fall in love with her. She also wants to take over the world.<br /><br />It doesn't really make a whole lot of sense, but neither did the \"Superman\" movies if you think about them too much. The problem with \"Supergirl\" is that she doesn't exactly have a whole lot to do. There's a dull action sequence involving a runaway backhoe, as well as a scene where Supergirl uses a lightning-charged streetlamp to ward off an invisible monster that's after her. In the backhoe sequence, we're asked to believe that the entranced landscaper could wander around the crowded town without actually looking at anybody, because Selena's spell dictates he'll fall in love with the first person he sees. Of course the first person he sees is Supergirl. This infuriates Selena to no end, and she forces Supergirl to take on a supernaturally powered Tilt-A-Whirl.<br /><br />Perhaps the biggest liability with \"Supergirl\" is the special effects. Putting it bluntly, they are awful. They may look alright on home video, but I just had the pleasure of catching \"Supergirl\" at a midnight showing on the big screen, and the audience was definitely not buying it. The matte visuals look fuzzy blown up on the screen, and an unwise sequence shows Supergirl changing clothes several times in a series of jumpy cuts as she walks behind trees. Argo City itself is a goofy concept. It's wrapped in what appears to be a clear plastic tarp that, when punctured, exposes Supergirl to the vacuum of...what? Inner space? Or the vacuum of this movie? It's never really clear. One tedious sequence takes place in the Phantom Zone, which has morphed from the flying plane of glass in the first films to a desolate terrain where it's possible to set up a roughly-hewn home, and they even give you controlled substances. Where IS Argo City, anyway? Why do Supergirl and the Omegahedron reach Earth by surfacing in a lake? Dunaway's performance, as well as a co-starring Brenda Vaccaro, helps the camp factor a great deal, but what is Peter O'Toole doing in this movie? It seems to me the producers wanted to lend some big-star weight to the cast a la Marlon Brando, but O'Toole's character winds up being mostly silly. Also note how Mia Farrow's credit appears early in the cast list, yet she has about four lines. Aside from Dunaway, whose scenery-chewing performance seems like a continuation of her \"Mommie Dearest\" routine, nobody really shines. Helen Slater actually does a great job as Supergirl, but the story is so confusing and dull that it doesn't really matter.<br /><br />A very big help would have been a cameo appearance from Christopher Reeve as Superman, who is nowhere to be seen. Don't drop your guard, or you might miss the explanation for his absence, which zooms by when Selena's car radio suddenly comes on.<br /><br />Apparently the international and directors cuts of the film helped to flesh out the ideas a little bit better, but the damage was done for this film once it hit theaters. It was generally considered a disaster, and watching it, it is easy to see why.\n",
      "Fay Dunaway and Brenda Vaccaro are the only real reasons to watch this movie. Those two women steal the show. <br /><br />Helen Slater as Supergirl was an okay choice, but it was her first film. She's come a long way (acting wise) since then. Still, it isn't her fault. <br /><br />The story is trite and the action sequences are muddled with silly attempts at comedy. <br /><br />The romance subplot was mind-numbingly ridiculous. <br /><br />Even Jimmy Olsen from the Superman films (Marc McClure) had a few schmaltzy scenes. <br /><br />This is so-not a good movie. Enough said...\n",
      "I started out liking this film, with its fine cast and hippy-dippy Argo City, but the film eventually gets so boring and goes on and on and on.. Especially on the \"director's cut\" DVD - it has 30 minutes of extra stuff that should have stayed out. If this film were skillfully edited down to about 1.5 hours it would be bearable, but some of the lines are pretty stupid, and the Dunaway character is no more than a cardborad cutout villain, with a pointless Brenda Vaccarro running around squawking about nothing. Watch this and you will enter a Phantom Zone - of boredom...\n",
      "The DC comic book heroes are so naturally interesting that it seems it would be very easy to make a good film here. However, they failed terribly. I found the film a little painful to watch. If I had another DVD on the coffee table I would have ended this one early.<br /><br />If you had to look for good things about this movie you can find a few. The actress paying Supergirl was very good. She really came across as a teenager with super powers  a little awkward at times, not always very self-assured. She was really good and had great schoolgirl good looks.<br /><br />However, it ends there. The dialog was strained. The story drug on, almost endlessly, with lack of action. The special effects were terrible even by 1984 standards (I often felt like I was watching the old Batman TV show). Someone else commented that they thought Faye Dunnaway was good. Sorry, I have to disagree. I felt the villains were just average, everyday, bad people  not the scheming, diabolical, evil but fascinating, super-villains typical in DC comics.<br /><br />If you want a good super-hero movie you need a great villain and a riveting plot that moves at a fast pace. You won't find that here. If someone would have warned me off seeing this they would have done me a favor. Hopefully I am doing that for you.\n",
      "From the Salkinds brothers, the same producers of \"Superman\" saga, comes the first and, for the moment, last adventure of the new heroine coming from DC comics: was Supergirl: the Superman's cousin. The movie is one of the worst superhero's pictures never made; director Jeannot Szwarc give very bad work, as on the hand we would expect from a subscriber to the flop like he. The screenplay by David Odell is really silly and campy; the history is absurd and full of holes. The plot: Kara(Helen Slater)is a blond young girl from Argo city. Argo is a fragment of the planet Krypton in \"innerspace\"; the survivor Community is powered by the Omega Hedron, a spherical powerful object invented by city's founder Zaltar(Peter O'Toole). Superman's cousin Kara is shown by Zaltar how to use Omegahedron to help inspire her art. But an insect she animates causes chaos and accidentally sucks the Omegahedron down a warp vortex. The magical sphere end up on Earth and falls into the clutches of a evil witch Faye Dunaway....sorry Selena(played by Faye Dunaway). Selena is a second-rate sorceress that lives in a converted amusement park with her sidekick Bianca(Brenda Vaccaro); the witch is studying black magic with the aid of her old boyfriend Nigel(Peter Cook); Nigel is a local math teacher and warlock. The eccentric Selena really is little more than a clumsy charlatan but she is really crazy and megalomaniac; her dream is nothing less than world domination! While Selena plans to use the sphere's powers to rule the world; Kara steals an experimental spaceship and on Earth, becoming Supergirl: the girl of steal; now the long-blond-tressed Kara enrolls in a girl-school as a brunette using the name Linda Lee, while searching for the Omegahedron in her spare time wearing the familiar costume of her cousin Superman. Selena is at that age where she's not the spring chicken; she develops lust for the handsome school gardener Ethan and spikes his beer with a potion that will make him fall for the first woman he sees and of course this women is Supergirl; she and Selena come into conflict. In the final crash the witch invoking the Burundi wand, she screams \"Power of Shadow... Appear!\" and she summons a huge demon. \"Power of Shadow... Destroy her!\" Flying up to confront the demon, Supergirl is captured in its grasp and it starts crushing her. Using her amazing strength, Supergirl frees herself from the demon and using her super-speed, Supergirl circles Selena and the wind she creates lifts Selena before the demon; Supergirl summons her inner strength to turn the tables and make the demon eat witch. Magically, the demon with her bore food and Bianca all fade away through the mirror to the Phantom Zone. Of course good triumphs over evil and Kara returns to Argo City with the Omegahedron. The movie's special effects aren't bad and the Jerry Goldsmith's score is wonderful. The majors guilty of this box office flop are Szwarc and Odell but the acting is another problem for this movie although the all-star cast. Nineteen year-old Helen Slater in her first film appearance is a perfect choice as Supergirl; she looked like she had jumped right out of the pages of the comic books for Supergirl, she's charming rather than sexy, graceful and convincing in the flying scenes with her little costume and her nice blonde hair. Supporting cast members include the completely wasted Peter Cook, the annoying Brenda Vacarro, a embarrassed Mia Farrow, as Kara's mother, the very attractive Hart Bochner that was quite good under trying circumstances and Peter O'Toole, who's always fun to watch when he overacts. All obviously were phoning it in for the paycheck. Faye Dunaway's acting is the worst in the movie. She is mostly dreadful as the wicked would-be witch Selena, it certainly wasn't all Faye Dunaway's fault, since she just got stuck with a terribly written character, but she was over-the-top hamming and overplays outrageously. Her character is idiot, boring and silly and Dunaway chews her ridiculous lines with unjustified gusto because her Selena remains the lamest and worst of all the villains from the Superman-related movies. Selena was the baddest evil witch of all time, with scenery-chewing of unimaginable proportions notwithstanding this Dunaway vamps like a enormous peacock but one thing is sure that she is not a charming and imperious witch like the glamorous Anjelica Huston in movie The Witches. Dunaway is really ungraceful and unattractive as a grotesquely middle-aged women that know some magic, gesture wildly, utter some made-up 'abracadabra' bullshit. She looks awful like a true classic witch from tales; with horrid red curly wig and a make-up that make her features coarse and more vulgar she seems a man in drag . But really Dunaway is the only reason for watch this movie because her camping is so over-the-top and her appearance is so bad than she becomes fascinating to watch in its terribleness. She likes herself in a way very narcissistic; I kept waiting for her performance to finally says -I ready for my close-up Mr. Demille-. But truly even cheeky Brenda Vaccaro as her accomplice Bianca reacts with comically exaggerated expressions over Faye's plans for world domination and her defines a horrid human being. There are few moments where Dunaway is really really ridiculous: when she was trying painfully to seduce the muscle-man Etahn; when she was prepare a love-potion with a spider and a hazel's shell but especially in the final when she rolls one's eyes and make terrible smirks and laughs. After her tour-de-force of overacting, her irritating wry faces and ways affected poor Dunaway end up really badly: a horrid monster bites evil Faye's head off. It's a just punishment for Dunaway's crimes against humanity, acting and fashion and it's a great relief for the audience.\n",
      "I felt the script let this down, the story seemed somewhat pathetic. It would have made a good comic book, but surely there was something better to translate into a movie!<br /><br />It is sad to see how the Superman franchise simply evaporated after the first 2 films. Thankfully rumours of a joint Superman - Supergirl film never materialised, and were possibly idol Hollywood gossip.\n",
      "I saw this movie at a free screening and was so disgusted I wanted my money back! It was one of the worst movies I've ever seen--boring, poorly written and acted, and woodenly directed--and that is saying something. Please do yourself the favor and never pay money to see this, ok?\n",
      "I can probably go on for days telling what is wrong with this movie. The movie starts out with the descendats of the planet Krypton living undersea. The movie does not explain how come Krypton people,who call themselves Argonanians, are living undersea. The next thing you know Supergirl loses the Argonanian power source (a crystal ball) and chases the crystal ball to Earth. Meanwhile Selena(Faye Dunway) using black magic and the power source tries to take over the world. Now Supergirl posing as college student Linda Lee makes friend with Jimmy Olson, and Lucy Lane, niece of Lois Lane. I lost track during the movie why Selena needed the power source to take over the world, but frankly towards the end of the movie I couldn't care. I was upset that producers did not have the decency to bring Superman or Lois Lane. Faye Dunway's acting in this movie is terrible, the only part of the villian Selena, Ms. Dunway got correct is the appearance. Dunway looks awful in this movie i.m.h.o. The only good part is 10 minute scene with Helen Slater and Peter O'Toole towards the conclusion, but even O'Toole acting skills can't save this film. My recommendation is that this movie is a cure for insomnia.\n",
      "This awful, seemingly low-budget knock-off of \"Superman\" features Helen Slater as the titular character, fighting off evil Faye Dunaway and Peter O'Toole. <br /><br />The movie is about as fun as a root canal, which will give you a good indication of just how enjoyable it is. It was definitely a cash-in on \"Superman's\" success in 1978, and the success of its sequels. However it lacks the solid style of \"Superman\" and is really, really low budget-y and cheap looking.<br /><br />I suppose this is just ample proof that there needed to be no \"Supergirl\" movie--at least not one like this. The scenes with the \"witch\" still make me cringe.<br /><br />Please, this deserves to be on the low 100. I absolutely hate it. It's even worse than \"Superman IV.\" Yes, I know that's saying a lot, but it is--quite unfortunately--true.<br /><br />P.S. I originally submitted this about two years ago but decided I'd revise a few of my sentences. I've gotten angry letters from the \"Supergirl Cult of IMDb\" giving me death threats telling me that it's an \"under-appreciated slice of epic film-making on par with The Lord of the Rings and The Godfather.\" I didn't like Lord of the Rings too much.<br /><br />Supergirl makes it look like the best film ever made.<br /><br />So, don't send me letters, and don't threaten me. If you think I'm wrong, write your own review.\n",
      "I felt this documentary about the Living Organisms of the Ocean was sloppy and rushed. There was some good footage but nothing earth shattering. Kate Nelligan was just OK as narrator. She had no pizazz. She was monotone and basically just going through the motions. Pardon the pun. The movie was short , only 35 minutes. It was just a lackadaisical effort . Seems like any amateur could get the footage that the makers of this documentary were able to get. I also felt the music was unnecessary. I love new age music , don't get me wrong , but I would have much rather have heard more of the natural sounds coming from the ocean. I am glad they mentioned something about some of the ocean plants that strive . Some of the facts about these plants were satisfying to hear. Still I can not give this movie any kind of kudos. I was simply; Very disappointed in this effort and would certainly not recommend this to others.\n",
      "What can I say about this movie. My expectations were something along the lines of evil dead 2, as it advertised, and I was sorely disappointed. Some ingenious ways of killing our hapless campers has everything to do with a pick axe you ever wanted to know about, and I got tired of it very quickly. Maybe they had some left over from My Bloody Valentine or Trackman. Crispin Glovers usually good creepy acting seemed out of place in this, like he was trying TOO hard to be creepy. He doesn't have to try, it comes naturally, like in Wizard of Gore. There were a few admirable killing scenes,the spinning log to be sure, and some above average makeup and special effects, but just not enough to merit a rental, and definitely not a purchase. It's as if the director is working to achieve the scary horror of ED2, and Glover is on that plane half the time, but someone forgot to inform the rest of the cast. The movie appeared to be just a jumble of film clips stitched together. My hope is that you will read this and spend your money elsewhere. I'm sure some people enjoy it, but it just missed the mark for me. Also don't expect to rent this movie and see Blake Lively(Accepted) or Robyn Lively(Savannah) in any screen time, they appear at the end of the movie in sort of a cameo role after everything of importance has happened. Funny that this movie was produced Lively production. Perhaps he saw the preview and thought,\"this movie sucks, maybe I can get members of my family to be in this and save it! NO, NO, NO. And for those who are wondering, at the end the twins have our heroine Kate trapped in a basement and have apparently engaged in some intercourse with her because I assume they have had children,(TWINS!). Hope this helps, but if not I don't care because you've seen the movie against my suggestion, and I've got better movies to waste two hours of my life with like (Insert movie of choice here). No evil dead, No Friday the 13th, no Nightmare, just crap. However, it is only MY opinion.\n",
      "First of all I saw this movie dubbed in German and German dubs of horror movies most of the time are ridiculous. In this case it somehow fit the plot and the characters. You get you basic horror movie setting... a bunch of teenagers go out to camp in the woods (Good one: \"You know a romantic place at the river? Something dark and creepy where serial killers walk around?\"). After the characters are introduced... funny stoner guy, hunky football guy, horny annoying chick, naive chick and the smart chick that is supposed to save the day... they stop for fuel and meet Sicko Stanley played by Crispin Glover. Crispin plays the two brothers Stanley and Simon who are the same person after all because Stanley turns out to be schizophrenic and playing the role of his dead brother Simon (whom he obviously killed like everyone else). So when they get to the camping site the usual serial killer story unfolds. That is packed with as many clichés as the opening of the movie. Girls fall down when fleeing the killer, stoner guy walks into a freezer with corpses, hunk guy gets mixed up between two girls and Stanley walks around, killing people with his crazy pickaxe catapult, stomping dogs, stabbing people, building funny dwarfs out of corpses and having a relaxing dinner with his dead rotting parents. A lot of this stuff is absolutely ridiculous, Stanley seems to have supernatural powers when pinning people to trees with pickaxes and making a human shishkebab. Some party made me laugh and reminded me of the Freddy Krueger Horror-Fun like when stoner guy is killed with a giant spliff and then set aflame. Anyway, the acting of all involved is pretty medium and the movie is not horrifying at all, although there really is some gory stuff in there. To me it came across like an extremely clichéd horror comedy that in many scenes made no sense at all (for example the dead horse woman pointing somewhere) and was stolen from loads of movies you know anyway.\n",
      "When I read the comments on this film and see the rating on IMDb I get to the conclusion that there are people who like this rubbish. Unbelievable I must say. If you are not a super fan of really bad bloody slasher movies, than don't see this movie.<br /><br />Slither was a movie that was over the top and kinda stupid, but all with this tongue in cheek kind a way. Simon Say's is to straight forward simple to give me the same feeling. It's all about butchering people with pickaxes. It starts and it never ends. Dogs are being splattered and so on. It is gross, not funny because it is too simple. Killing people with pickaxes is not funny after 6 times. And that Crispin Glover dude. He seems to have a career in these movies, a cult figure so to speak. A guy who refuses a role in Back to the future II and sues Steven Spielberg is an extraordinary guy. But this is an extraordinary bad movie.\n",
      "I'm a devout Crispin Glover fan, and will always give a watch to anything he's in. From classics to genre oddities to mainstream pap, he's had a career that touches many points.... while the productions he's in might not all be winners, at least he can be counted-on for an entertaining (and often unique) performance.<br /><br />Not so with SIMON SAYS. This movie is just dismal. Obviously shot on DV and starring a cast of poorly-played stereotypes, SIMON SAYS feels like a student-film... it tries hard at times, but just keeps failing. Story - non-existent Characters - generic and stiff Dialogue - embarrassing SFX - way wayyyy too much (unconvincing) CGI<br /><br />I wanted to just stop the flick early and end my pain, but ultimately I was drawn to know what on earth Crispin Glover saw in this project. I mean, maybe he did it strictly for the money (and if this production *DID* ever have a budget, certainly most of it MUST have gone to his salary). I have to presume that's the only reason he signed-onto this pile of crap. <br /><br />Avoid this one. It isn't fun, it isn't \"so-bad-it's-good\"... it's just a p!ss-poor piece of crap.\n",
      "When I saw all these positive comments and talk about different movie I was expecting something similar to what Scream did for slasher genre or something like it. Boy was I disappointed.<br /><br />Granted movie does have and interesting and unconventional opening but then it falls for every horror cliché around. Location, obviously. Middle of nowhere, woods. Characters are your typical group of teenagers. We don't know why they choose to camp there, we don't know who they are or practically anything about it. And you have your typical tight girl, your \"friendly\" girl, stoner/funny guy and so on. And of course the typical \"I know there is something weird going on around here but instead of turning around and running away I'll keep poking around so I'll find bodies and body parts.\" While first such case is somewhat understandable the second one is beyond dumb.<br /><br />Then we have death scenes. Not that gory but between dumb and impossible. When you think about them a bit you realize this is just not possible.<br /><br />The ending is interesting, I'll give them that but one good moment simply can't fix overall bad impression this movie makes.<br /><br />Avoid if possible\n",
      "The story of \"Simon says\" is nothing new. Some teenagers in the wood get hunted down by some sicko. So, I didn't expect much anyway in that regard. Still, the movie disappointed me. The teenagers are just your basic clichés for this kind of movie, which is not necessarily bad, but the main problem is the main character, Simon. In my opinion he's just way overdone. The acting is almost like a caricature. So, what should be a threatening character ends up being a (sadly bad) joke. The kills are good, but that's about it. Everything else in this movie just is below par, even for the genre. <br /><br />Still, with a better Simon this movie could be fun. With that guy it's more a pain to watch than anything else. Avoid this movie.\n",
      "You'd be hard-pressed to find any redeeming qualities in director Bill Dear's new film, \"Simon Says\". It's juvenile, cliché-ridden, and utterly lame.<br /><br />Simon (Crispin Glover) owns a store in the middle of nowhere that sells nothing. He has an apparent affinity for pick-axes, with dozens adorning the walls of his shed/store. Whenever he comes across other humans, he sports his best retard voice and begins asking goofy questions. No matter the reply, he grins stupidly, mumbles \"you forgot to say 'Simon says'\", and then proceeds to kill everyone in the scene.<br /><br />The characters take on the most banal forms of teen stereotyping. There's a stoner dude, a meat head jock, a prudish Asian, and two rank-and-file sluts. None of them contributes anything of significance to the story. The dialog is contrived and forced. The actors might as well be reading from cue-cards. Rent any porno and you're likely to find stronger performances.<br /><br />One neat twist is that the laws of physics do not apply within a 1-mile radius of Simon's store. Axes have infinite momentum. Some people can jump and change direction in mid-air. Others can magically teleport into charred corpses.<br /><br />Simon's many strange catapults, which he can reload at the speed of light, rain an impossible number of axes down on his victims. His single-ax launcher is extraordinarily precise, piercing the chest of a perfectly useless character from more than 100 yards away.<br /><br />There is no actual plot. Just a bunch of sterile characters being killed in impossible ways by an aspiring loon.<br /><br />There are attempts at humor. None work. By the end of the movie, I realized the joke was on me.<br /><br />Grade: F Avoid at all costs.\n",
      "The first in a poliziottesco trilogy featuring Maurizio Merli as Commissioner Betti; the first and last entries were directed by Girolami under the alias of Franco Martinelli and the second by Umberto Lenzi.<br /><br />As such, this one certainly set the template for the others: its plot involves a gang of crooks who commit four armed robberies throughout the course of the film (from a bus, a supermarket, a restaurant and a bank) - where the culprits, sloppily, contrive to always leave behind a victim - which sends the iconoclastic cop (obviously inspired by Clint Eastwood's Inspector \"Dirty\" Harry Callahan) on their trail. The action sequences - which also take in several beatings, a rape (committed in front of the girl's ageing father) and car chases - are certainly capably staged which, propelled by a pounding score from Guido and Maurizio De Angelis (better known as \"Oliver Onions\"), give the film an unrelenting pace that ensures it never slips into boredom despite its being predictable at every turn! <br /><br />The second half, however, is quite interesting: Merli quits the force after shooting a hood (John Steiner) in 'cold-blood' - apparently, it little matters to his superiors that the latter had done the same to undercover cop and Merli protégé Ray Lovelock, who remains paralyzed for life! - but is called into 'service' for a different kind of justice by a small band of former victims, led by lawyer Richard Conte, who have turned vigilante!!\n",
      "I think my fellow reviewers are overstating things a bit. Roma Violenta is by no means a bad movie, but it does nothing any number of poliziotteschi films can't do better and it doesn't impress with what it does either.<br /><br />Maurizio Merli plays another inspector, this time Commisarrio Betti. There's a healthy number of car chases, fistfights, gundowns and just about anything you would expect from a film of this kind, but it's all done with such a workmanlike air from Marino Girolami (Castellari's father) that I couldn't help but glance at my watch every now and then. Girolami does Roma Violenta with the get-it-over-with attitude of a professional instead of the enthusiasm of a fan. Get in, take the master shot, take the close-ups, get it over with cos there's a paycheck in the end. No imagination whatsoever. I can imagine him on set crossing things off a list: \"Car chase? Check. Fistfight? Check\".<br /><br />Polizioto fans that need their fix will be satisfied by Roma Violenta, but if you haven't seen true genre classics like The Cynic, The Rat and The Fist, Almost Human or La Mala Ordina, then Roma Violenta can wait.\n",
      "I had high hopes for this because: 1) It was called LEGION OF THE DEAD and had box art of some ancient Egyptian tomb king and a whole army of undead troopers.<br /><br />2) It had Bruce Boxleitner in.<br /><br />3) Putting together 1 + 2, and armed with the knowledge that Boxleitner plays the sheriff, it implies some sort of gigantic apocalyptic battle with hordes of mummies will occur, sort of like the battles in Lord of the Rings or even Army of Darkness.<br /><br />Now without giving any spoiler information away: The actual plot of the movie is nothing like the assumptions you are lead to be believe from facts 1 and 2 above and the film was therefore a severe disappointment for me. Had they re-named it, it might have been less of a let down.<br /><br />However, the acting IS poor, the plot is VERY dubious (in terms of the genre; I know mummies walking around is inherently dubious, but there are ways of doing it right and this film doesn't due to inconsistencies). That being said the comedic gore and the amount of breasts are about right.\n",
      "With the exception of the newly resurrected Full Moon movies, the Asylum distributes and produces the absolute worst horror movies on the video store shelves. The Asylum's legacy of lousiness continues with their Mummy epic, Legion of the Dead.<br /><br />This movie is basically like Queen of the Damned with mummies instead of vampires and with Bruce Boxleitner and the kid from Gremlins instead of Aaliyah. This tepid tale begins when a couple of dirt bikers stumble on an ancient Egyptian burial tomb somewhere in the mountains of Los Angeles. You heard me right, this ancient Egyptian burial chamber is in the foothills of Los Angeles. Somehow those wacky Egyptians managed to make it all the way to California with a bunch of their loot and sarcophagus with a Queen Mummy in it. The Gremlins kid (can't remember his name) is an archaeologist who is summoned to the site after the two dirt bikers tell the cops about what they found.<br /><br />The Gremlins guy leads a team on an expedition into the burial chamber. There's ten minutes of Indiana Jones shenanigans as our intrepid explorers make their way through into the tomb. Poisoned arrows, cryptic warnings written in hieroglyphs and trap doors abound. They make it through a winding maze of styrofoam cave walls and find a sarcophagus with an ancient Queen Mummy in it. Of course, they awaken this mummy from her slumber and it turns into an episode of Scooby Doo. The Queen Mummy reanimates a bunch of her mummy pals and they make short work of our explorers.<br /><br />As far as the story goes, it doesn't get any more cookie cutter than this. It's shot on someone's camcorder, just like all the other offerings from the Asylum. The acting is cardboard. Overall, it's just a complete waste of time. My hope is that all lovers of horror movies will stop renting and buying these cheap, irritating movies from the Asylum. Maybe if they realize that they can't make a profit churning out these foul flicks, they will stop making them. I sure hope so.\n",
      "A real shame of a movie. Spiritless and full of clichés. What really got me angry was the inconsistency of the soldiers' ability to fight. They acted like powerless zombies when they fought the good guys, but pulled the backbone of some victims in one firm jerk! I mean, c'mon! It's the kind of movie you cannot watch even for laughs. Well, I did. And that only because I kept waiting for something to happen. It was so lame I could throw up. Even if you are a horror movies fan - trust me, this is an outrageous kitsch. It's the type of production that one does for money only, not because one has a real story or a genuinely artistic view to a story. It looks like five-year old kids playing in the backyard - although this remark may be offensive to the intellect of any five-year-old, or two-year-old for that matter! Omaldy.\n",
      "When an ancient Egyptian tomb is found in a North American park, a group of scientists and students of Egyptology arrive to the site to study the inscriptions. Meanwhile, the four thousand years old evil high-priestess Aneh-Tet (Claudia Lyns) awakes and seeks six offerings to revive her legion of mummies. Then she needs the blood of a virgin to bring her father back to life, become immortal and rule the world.<br /><br />I bought this DVD based on the name of Bruce Boxleitner and the wonderful art of the cover of the DVD. However, the story is very disappointing, and I particularly liked two scenes: the nudity of the gorgeous and sexy Claudia Lyns, and the funny line of Sheriff Jones, when he says to his skeptical assistant: \"- Just because a chicken has wings doesn't mean it can fly.\" My vote is two.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): Not Available\n",
      "I really do not like being harsh but this movie is awful! I mean sometimes I find at least one good thing to say about a movie but there nothing good to be said about this one. There is a a lot of senseless action in the movie that has no flow, people die needlessly and repeatedly, there is scary music when there is no need for it, importance is placed on certain roles and then they are removed from the movie by being killed off, and the action scenes involving the lead actress is like watching a Barbie doll trying to defend herself. Especially at the end when she plants the ankh in the neck of the woman! It really looks like she does not have the strength to hold the ankh let alone drive it through someone's neck. Also let's not forget how she evades the mummies at the motel. She can play an intellect in front of a camera but someone put this actress in a class that teaches how to act out action scenes. <br /><br />I usually keep a copy of all my movies but not of this one. I am deleting this one just like I deleted Gargoyles by Jim Wynorski.\n",
      "I know these movies are supposed to be stupid--but they must always provide marginal entertainment. Unfortunately, this movie is worse than just its formula plot, commodity script, laughably sad production values and stupefying nature (brain cells will be lost). It is a FRAUD.<br /><br />You CANNOT give Bruce Boxleitner and Gremlins-boy billing on the box as the featured actors, and have both of those characters die, complete with perhaps 20 minutes of worthless screen time for both combined. I do not give one Piece of Cr*p about the no-name actresses who become the heroes of the mentally challenged story. The marketers behind this film, and any knowingly involved in this scam should be ashamed--and they owe me money!\n",
      "Legion of the Dead starts as a young & attractive Egyptology student named Molly (Courtney Clonch) pulls up to an extraordinary find somewhere in California, apparently there's an Egyptian tomb that's been unearthed out in the sticks somewhere. Dr. Ari Ben-David (Rhett Giles) & Dr. Swatek (Zach Galligan) are in charge & they are both very excited, however a great evil has been awakened in the shape of the re-animated Egyptian priestess Aneh-Tet (Claudia Lynx) who needs 6 souls to bring her 6 zombie mummies back to life & take over the world with the aid of a big slimy monster thing which can only be brought into this world by a virgin sacrifice. Molly discovers whats going on & it's up to her to save the day!<br /><br />Apparently shot under the cheeky title of Unravelled, written & directed by Paul Bales I thought Leigon of the Dead was an OK time waster although many may feel I'm being too generous with that description. The script obviously uses mummies & ancient Egyptian mythology presumably to try & cash-in on the huge success & popularity of Universal's two recent Mummy films with Brendan Fraser, unfortunately the budget didn't stretch to any location filming so in flash of inspiration the filmmakers thought to themselves if we can't go to Egypt Egypt will have to come to us in California! Hence the absurd notion of an ancient Egyptian tomb in the middle of rural California which isn't where the silliness stops but since Legion of the Dead is just a low budget horror film I doubt anyone involved was aiming for authenticity, if you know what I mean. I wasn't convinced about the unlikely notion that if you make a groundbreaking discovery like the one in the film the only people you bring in are young, hunky teenage students to assist you. The character's & dialogue aren't great but they suffice although what saves Legion of the Dead is some reasonable gore, the fact it's a little bit different, it has some good looking birds in it & it moves along at a fair pace. As I said it's an OK way to pass the time, just don't expect a masterpiece because this ain't it.<br /><br />Director Bales does OK & keeps the annoying MTV style nonsense down to a minimum, it actually looks like a professional film which I guess I should be grateful for on it's own considering some of the low budget horror crap that's floating around out there. I wouldn't call Legion of the Dead particularly scary & the action scenes lack a certain spark although the zombie mummies are quite cool. There's some decent gore here, there's various melting faces, a ripped out heart & a couple of really cool bits where people have their spines ripped out which is novel (if you haven't played Mortal Kombat) if nothing else. There's some nudity as well if that sort of thing interests you.<br /><br />I have to say I'm pretty impressed with Legion of the Dead considering the supposed $500,000 budget, it looks alright & while the special effects aren't going to win any awards they're not too bad. For what it is it's reasonably well made & the acting is OK as well although it saddens to see decent actors like Zach Galligan & Bruce Boxleitner reduced to bit-part roles in films such as this.<br /><br />Legion of the Dead isn't a great film that's for sure but I found it a mildly entertaining way to pass 90 odd minutes although I wouldn't be able to argue with anyone who called it crap, not as bad as I was expecting but still far from what one might call a good film.\n",
      "My friend is on a quest to watch all things Bruce Boxleitner, and I, being a good friend agreed to watch this with her. Words cannot ex press how poorly this was acted, produced, edited, and written. I understand all the no name actors in it, no shame on them for taking a paying gig. But shame on Bruce for sullying his good name! The worst part was the concept...spoiler alert! that the Egyptians had a trans-Atlantic trade route...to Southern California. I am hoping the writers were forced to change the location due to production costs, but there could have been some sort of compromise that didn't involve stupidity. Bottom line: NEVER RENT THIS MOVIE OR WATCH IT ON TV!!!\n",
      "Of course I already knew at advance that this movie would be a bad one but in a way the movie was even worse than I could had ever anticipated.<br /><br />Real problem with this movie is how amateur like it got made. Bad directing, bad editing, and bad camera work. It also doesn't help that the movie is very cheap looking, this lets the movie look all the more weak and ridicules.<br /><br />The sound also got messed up pretty bad. The one moment some of its sound effects are too loud while the other things and dialog are too soft. This is also variating and at times you can't even hear some of the characters, while the others are clearly understandable, even when they are in the same scene's at times.<br /><br />Also the story is just plain ridicules. I mean, an Egyptian mummy buried somewhere in the good old USA? It's just their way of saying; we want to do a mummy movie but we don't have the money or resources to go for Egypt for it or try the recreate it somewhere else. Also the way the entire story progresses results in the fact that nothing in the story just ever works really out. It makes the movie boring and real tiresome to watch. And of course the story needs to feature a couple of teenagers in the main lead but oh well this always had been the case in these sort of genre movies since the '70's on. The movie and it's story really start to get out of control as it heads more and more toward its incredibly poorly done last 20 minutes.<br /><br />The scare effects of the movie just don't work out and they try to enhance it by adding some gore but instead it works out all the more ridicules since it's just not very convincing looking. The special effects are just too lame. The movie also doesn't exactly get scary due to the fact that the mummy is a beautiful, young, half-nude, Arabic girl.<br /><br />The acting in this movie is all in all not that bad, especially considering the genre but of course the actors aren't exactly helped by the movie its incredible weak and silly script. What's even the main point in the movie its story? The movie really isn't going anywhere with its story. There is mummy on the loose who kills a lot of people in an horrible way but yet no one seems to be worried about the fact that their friends getting killed. The cast mostly consists out of young unknowns with the exception perhaps of Bruce Boxleitner who is a well known in certain circles.<br /><br />Well OK there are worse movies to watch out there but that doesn't make this movie a good one. The fact that the movie has such a tiresome story is the foremost reason that this movie is a completely dull one that certainly isn't recommendable, not even for the genre fans or lovers of 'bad movies'.<br /><br />2/10\n",
      "Another brain dead selection from the production company Asylum. LEGION OF THE DEAD attempts to mix mummy movie with sexploitation flick. The result, hardly a first, looks like an inferior remake of the much-maligned LIFEFORCE. This time, instead of a naked space-vampire chick that sucks the lifeforce out of entranced males, we get a naked mummy-vampire chick that sucks the lifeforce out of entranced males.<br /><br />Calling this movie a rip-off would be a compliment, however. It would ignore how really bad this film is. Unconvinced? Think about this: the best feature of the movie is the bad acting.<br /><br />So what are we left with? There's laughable CGI. A \"legion of the dead\" that amounts to a few badly made up mummies. An Egyptian tomb set that appears to have been made of cardboard (but perhaps that's how California's ancient Eyptians once constructed them). I kid you not, people. This tomb was discovered in the woods of Southern California. And don't make me start on the script. Please. I don't want to think about it in any kind of detail.<br /><br />Worst of all, I saw this damn thing on the Sci-Fi Channel, so the main reason for its existence (the nudity) was edited/blurred out.\n",
      "From director Paul Bales (who is known for absolutely nothing) comes this typical mummy thriller involving a major archaeological find. As it turns out, the Egyptian's had a secret trans-Atlantic trade route which surprised diggers when a burial tomb was discovered in America. They find the mummified remains of a 4000 year old High-queen who is unintentionally summoned back to life by a professor's student. The (incredibly hot) queen goes about stealing souls from those who run into her and she ends up taking control of the professor (played by Mr. Rhett \"my career is damned to go straight to video forever\" Giles), whom she uses to help resurrect the Six - a gang of warriors to assist her in conquering the world. The end seems to re-cap every other movie dealing with resurrected mummies (The Fallen Ones comes right to mind) in which a virgin is about to be sacrificed and is saved at the last minute... Very boring and unoriginal movie.\n",
      "The movie itself was pretty dull, and most the acting was a little cheesy. I did think that the girl who played the lead character, Molly, was great! She gave this movie the only real depth it carried. I hope she will continue to pursue her career, and that others will see what an incredible talent she really is. As for the plot, you could drive a semi through the wholes in this movie. It was so completely unbelievable that it was hard to watch. None of the characters were written with any depth and only a truly talented actor could bring any believability to it. I think that the majority of people in this film should give up hope of ever doing anything besides cheesy C rated movies or maybe porn. Everyone except the lead actress whom I mentioned before.\n",
      "There are five combat sequences that make this flick worth your ticket--maybe 20 minutes worth seeing in the entire film. The CGI is excellent, especially the Gotha bomber. Wow. And the Zeppelin ain't bad.<br /><br />Having said that: It's riddled with factual and historical errors, ALL of which were avoidable had the writers/director cared to pay attention. (It probably would have cost nothing to do it right.) <br /><br />A short list would include: Nonexistent aircraft in 1916 such as the Fokker Triplanes (all of them red except the black one!), Sopwith Camel, SE-5, and Bristol Fighter.<br /><br />The concept of training pilots to fly in a combat squadron is of course absurd but the director apparently thought it necessary as a plot device.<br /><br />French airmen learning to fly in a British airplane (Sopwith Strutter) is equally absurd.<br /><br />For the real hair splitters, the Gotha and some triplanes have the straight-edged Balkan crosses that appeared two years later. Other fingernails on the blackboard include \"9mm Spandau\" machine guns (they were 7.92 Mauser) and \"canvas\" covering on the wings when cotton or linen were used because canvas was much too heavy.<br /><br />But beyond that, the script takes a pedestrian approach to what could have been a more evocative, even inspiring, film. There are no standout performances, and the syrupy, chaste romance goes nowhere. The only reason for including it probably was to draw in more of an audience as a date flick (not quite a chick flick.) For those of us who truly enjoy aviation films, this one proved a major disappointment but hey, within limits, almost any WW I flying flick is better than no WW I flying flick.\n",
      "If you want to see a movie in which the CGI flying sequences are cluttered and unconvincing, where the hero takes no evasive action at all as the nasty guy in the black Fokker sits on his tail taking careful aim, where airplanes continuously fly through the camera, where bullets make holes as big as pie plates when they hit fabric instead of punching though it, where our hero cannot lift the fabric-covered wing off his friend's hand, where a girl learns English in two easy lessons, where the Squadron CO gives the hero a medal for disobeying a direct order, where the hero is out of uniform half the time, and where nobody at all says a damned thing worth listening to, then by all means go see \"Flyboys\".<br /><br />But if you'd like to see a movie about the same subject in which the action sequences are actually exciting, something is said about war that is worth thinking about and the characters are well-played, go rent \"The Dawn Patrol\", made in 1938.<br /><br />Twenty times better than this.<br /><br />No, on second thought, fifty times better than this.\n",
      "Talk about ineptitude (among other things), this supposed homage to an actual WWI squadron perpetuates just about every conceivable cliché imaginable, furthermore effectively stealing elements from nearly every aviation flick ever devised, including Blue Max, the Dawn Patrol, Dark Blue World, the Tuskegee Airmen, and even that age-old silent flick from 1927, WINGS. Furtherome, the battle scenes themselves reflect the most cheesy elements of propaganda war flicks, culminating in the endless ranks of snarling villains, the cheering crowds on the ground below as our heroes intercept the strafing Huns to save the day, and even a veritable race against the proverbial clock to destroy a German airship before it supposedly \"obliviates\" the entirety of Paris.<br /><br />And as of the various manners in which this film blatantly exhibits its readily apparent lack of prowess for historical and technical accuracies, let me count the ways.<br /><br />For starters, let's consider the countless manners in which the on-screen aircraft repeatedly defy the laws physics. Admittedly, some reviewers have pointed out Tony Bill's part-time profession as an aerobatic pilot, which in essence appears to compromised his interpretations of World War I combat, as he seems to have derived his perception of first world war fighters from having logged too many hours in Pitts Special as opposed to having derived genuine insight into the performance capabilities and limitations of such elaborate contusions of fabric and wood. For one thing, the aircraft exhibit speeds twice in excess of the actual performance capabilities of World War I fighters, culminating in a host of physical implausibilities as overly efficient climbing characteristics as if instigated in the absence of a stall barrier, low-level maneuvers that would have invariably either stalled the aircraft or resulted in considerable wing shear, not to mention that these biplanes and Triplanes exhibit phenomenal roll-rates which no multi-winged aircraft on the planet could possibly emulate. Evidently, Tony Bill exhibits an accurate conception of three dimensional space, but not of the actual performance characteristics of World War One aircraft.<br /><br />Furthermore, the movie's glaring affinity for historical inaccuracy reflects the presence of numerous aircraft that never existed during the Escardrille's 1916 escapades, including the SE.5, Handley Page 400, Gotha IV, and of course the Fokker Dr. 1 Triplane, which brings me to another issue that drives me out of my mind, culminating in one of the most trivial misconceptions about World War I aviation. Bottom line, the above depiction stems from a childish conception that by default associates World War One German aviation with countless formations of red-coated Triplanes, as if the Germans had somehow managed to perpetuate endless clones of Von Richtofen, to say nothing about the fact that the Fokker Dr. 1 was ultimately produced in insignificant numbers, culminating in an actual production run of only 160 examples.<br /><br />In fact, the Lafayette Escabdrille fought the majority of its pitched-battles against outmoded Fokker E.III Eindeckers and two-seat Albatross and Aviatik observation scouts, the superior equipment of the Amercans frequently offset by their readily apparent lack of experience.<br /><br />And another thing, the average life expectancy of a World War I pilot is actually confined to the space of a single week, unlike the film's more optimistic projection of 3 to 6. Furthermore, somebody should remind the screenwriters never to emphasizes the virtues of German aircraft by citing the presence of all powerful engines, as the rates of horsepower which the Germans managed to conceive lagged considerably behind that of their allied counterparts.<br /><br />Furthermore, pilots were indeed NOT permitted to instill their own personal insignias, considering that, unlike World War II, pilots were rarely assigned individual aircraft, often dispersing their ranks among the types available and typically sharing planes out amongst each other. Furthermore, as depicted within the closing scene, there is simply no such thing as rejoining one's formation in the event of finalizing an aerial skirmish, as aircraft frequently fought pitched battles at length, scattering miles away from each other, thus relaying each pilot with the burden of utilizing landmarks and navigations skills as the sole means for finding their way home on an individual basis.<br /><br />Reverting to the film's one and only redeeming feature, the various aspects in which the Flyboys attempts to model battle damage in conjunction with the various behaviors of shedding wings and burning engines bear a more accurate depiction than the remainder of the film. However, given the all too elaborate staging of such sequences through an over use of Green Screen techninques in conjunction with an overabundance of CGI effectively renders the overall appearance as reminiscent of, as one reviewer stated, \"playing a really cool video game\" as opposed to providing a genuine \"in the cockpit\" sensation for piloting such frail machinations.<br /><br />Most offensive, however, is the gratuitous manner in which the movie concocts the entire spectacle within a fanciful dressing of glamour, all the while pedaling it's pretensions for historical and physical accuracy.<br /><br />In all fairness, perhaps I should lend Tony Bill an additional bone by citing the best moment of the entire movie, in which the guts of that blabbering Christian fanatic splatters the entirety of his instrument panel.<br /><br />Ultimately, the photograph at the end of the actual members of the Lafayette Escadrille seems like a cruel joke, as if the preceding spectacle of cartoonish escapism somehow culminates in an authentic tribute to the squadron in question.<br /><br />Considering the shear sparsity of world war one related aviation flicks, it doesn't take a genius to brand this endeavor as by far the worst ever conceived.<br /><br />For more informative and productive viewing, I can suggest virtually every other aviation flick on the market, from the veritable classics like \"Blue Max\" and \"Aces High\" , to some of the more lukewarm efforts of \"Ace of Aces\" and \"Von Richtofen and Brown\".\n",
      "The first problem I have with this film is in it's opening titles claiming to be based on a true story. This sets you up with anticipation that the filmmakers have developed this film aiming for authenticity, recreating what it was like to be the first fighter pilots in the first modern war. For the first time films makers have the tools with CGI to truly accurately portray the visceral effects of WWI dog fighting to put the audience right back into the thick shell smoked 1916 western front.<br /><br />However they fall VERY short of the mark because through their obsession with their aerial money shots, they seem to have forgotten the human story of the true horrors of combat and what it does to the human soul. In the fact it's the human story that the director makes the biggest hash of. It's Horrors of war painted by numbers, lets have the veteran seen it all, lets have the fearless guy and then just so people know war can be nasty lets have a shell shock guy. But this is done so distastefully it truly mocks people who have actually been traumatized by war.<br /><br />This films claims to have the most authentic aerial combat footage ever put to film. The CGI shots are also no where near as good as the film makers think they are. In many cases they come across as in game movie footage from an Xbox360, cartoon like and unreal. The filmmakers have also made no effort to research their period, without creating any spoilers there is some truly ludicrous almost James Bond like action set pieces that take away all sense that you are watching a realistic war film. The bi-planes might as well have afterburners and laser beams and fly into space, the film wouldn't be any less believable and probably a lot more interesting.<br /><br />This is nothing more than a boys own story; where the first casualty is truth or realism. It has a TV movie feel and the acting is so bad you couldn't care less who lives or dies by the end of it. This film could have offered so much but it seems the director and the produces bottled out and aimed for an arcade computer style shoot em up with shallow acting and a big helping of cartoon CGI.\n",
      "OK I love history and war stories, good war stories. This isn't one of them.<br /><br />Don't know why I'm posting this as it coming this late no one will be reading this, but I've got to get this off my chest because I've heard so many people say great things about this movie and I'm not just a little disappointed. The heavy use of the Folker DR1 Tri-planes was just too much. Those came in later in the war and not used in such large numbers, and why so many were made to look like the most infamous one of all was just bad taste. I'm glad I didn't go see this at the theaters, but I'm still disappointed I paid to rent this movie.\n",
      "I really wanted to like this film as the rarity of WW1 epics in today's Hollywood is noticeable. In the end, I was left disappointed at a movie that meshes CGI action with a Pearl-Harbor-ish love story and cliché characters that have reunited from most every other war film here. There's the brash cowboy lead, the minority figure (whom I though could have been used a lot better than he was), the \"religious guy\", the hardened veteran ace and his nemesis (whom flies his own black-and-white aircraft so we can distinguish him from his red-colored henchmen friends) - gosh.<br /><br />The first 20 minutes starts out honest enough, but the disappointment followed shortly thereafter. How is our hero allowed to FLY A PLANE OFF OF THE AIRBASE to visit and woo his French girlfriend - whom by the way picks up English in a surprisingly short amount of time? A scene where our hero lands his aircraft, runs through the middle of an ongoing battle and tries to lift a paper-mache aircraft off of the hand of one of our other heroes - are you kidding me? Anywho, the plane is too heavy for me to lift so I'll just have to CUT YOUR ARM OFF! Are you kidding me? It had me laughing it was so pathetic. I thought we'd seen the end of the one-armed pilot but on no - they've affixed a hook for a hand so he can continue on with the sub par script. Again - laughing hysterically now as I watched the film. The hook isn't even CGI-ed in there, it's just an obvious cover for his existing hand - making his one arm to what looks like a foot longer than the other.<br /><br />To add insult to injury, they give this poor chap some hokey battle cries like \"Knights of the Air!\" and \"Beware of the Hook!\".<br /><br />By film's end, all credibility is lost. Jean Reno's prowess is sorely underused in this film. Some French is spoken in the beginning and adds credibility, but by mid-film, the production must have moved back to LA or something cause it's all English from there.<br /><br />What we need from an attempt like this is something more along the lines of history - make all of these young me who they really were! I was saddened to see a picture of the real Escadrille at the end of the film, as if this film is some kind of testament to their sacrifice and service. Yah - just like Pearl Harbor was for the sailors of the Pacific Fleet.<br /><br />The ONLY thing one can take away from this is the four or five semi-respectable dogfight scenes, though the aircraft are filmed with what seems to be turbojet power aircraft and fly-by-wire control. Stalling only seems to occur when the script calls for it. Our hero makes several dead-on shots from a six-shooter from HIS PLANE at ANOTHER pilot. No wind resistance is taken into effect mind you, otherwise our hero could win this war all by himself if they keep him in the trenches.<br /><br />Get it from your library for free if you can or watch it on an inflight plane trip. Otherwise, pass on this...\n",
      "Poor Jean Reno. Stuck in cinematic farce like this. That bored, suffering look upon his face throughout the film can only be his French impatience waiting for this stinking film to end! Technical inaccuracies, historical inaccuracies, inept special effects -- there are so many things here to compete with the film's sophomoric script in motivating the viewer to hit the \"eject\" button long before the actual end. The wonder of the thing is that you do occasionally find yourself caught up in some subplot that seems to have generated itself amidst the bounteous tripe. If you want to see a well-made movie in this genre, better to rent \"The Blue Max\" (1960s) and enjoy an hour and a half of real cinema.\n",
      "I just bought this film for my dad, a big history and war film buff. I thought it'd right up his alley with some historical facts and right up my alley with some exciting air battles. Boy was I wrong! The story was a complete drag! This clumsy, plodding script unfolds slowly and predictably. James Franco and Martin Henderson were horrible. Really it took all my strength to not shuttle forward to get to the battle scenes. The battle scenes were horrible as well! According to this film there are never more than 12 people on the frontlines of WWI and almost nobody bleeds. Granted I didn't see the film in the theater but the air battles were totally phony looking. My 72 year old dad with his bad eyes turned to me and said \"this looks like a video game\". There was no point where this film was able to grab my interest. Sure the design on the planes were cool but that had nothing to do with this film. So are you gonna see this film for the hokey unexciting battle scenes or the plodding script? There were two pros for the film: Lucienne the love interest is beautiful and it was nice to get a glimpse of what happened with the Lafayette Escadrille.\n",
      "Seriously, this movie is just a piece of expensive trash.<br /><br />Only thing really worth looking is probably the beautiful scenes of nature and nice places & people around. Photography is simply gorgeous! But wasn't this movie about WAR?<br /><br />Well, computer-generated war, without real dialogue or matter to discuss, idea to present, etc. Just 3D models and characters suitable for girly Sunday soap opera, not hard-boiled war movie.<br /><br />Even if it tries simply to be digital form of art and nothing else (I wouldn't call this a thriller or typical war movie of any kind), it fails also. I won't start with factual errors, they're clear to anyone ever opened history book. But the CGI... It's horrible. <br /><br />First, the CGI scenes don't look that good at all. For a 2006 movie, they seemed to use technology from year 2000 or so. The plane models don't have really any complex shading or any other modern light simulation applied, so everything looks even worse than a typical PC video game from same year. There's also heavily noticeable lack of realistic shadows. But this is not the worst part.<br /><br />Planes are extremely overpowered and feel like something Man hasn't built yet. Like superb aero-acrobatic devices even our modern technology can't do. It looks nice, but hey, wasn't this movie about WWI? Shouldn't those... things be a pieces of wood and cloth with a small engine applied? Simply motorized kites? But even that total mess-up in CGI and directing department isn't the worst part.<br /><br />The worst question is... where's PHYSICS? If CGI department would have recorded a demo from early 1994 flight simulator and used movement capture of game planes for ones seen in movie, they would get at least half of it believable. But in this movie, planes float. They have no mass or friction, no speed nor gravity. And in era of motorized kites, tiny amounts of speed and angles defined by physics law was what really decided who won the dogfight. It was all about pilot playing on the edge of plane's capabilities, milliseconds and laws on nature to gain this tiny, almost invisible advantage over enemy. No pilot had 360-degree freedom in 3 dimensions at constant speed. In this movie, it doesn't matter if pilot rises or drops plane, it doesn't lower or raise his speed a bit.<br /><br />And there's a terribly stupid scene with protagonist's gun jamming while enemy is at gunpoint. Just look at this: When enemy notices the problem, he speeds up and flies away. Why in the hell was he flying at gunpoint until then? Weren't German planes much faster and more maneuverable? Doesn't EVERY damn historical air battle-related book describe this?<br /><br />I won't even start with \"romance\" and \"drama\" portions from the movie. The unbelievable fights (to any sane man) and pretty actors already defined the target group of the movie: early teenage girls. So it's needed by default, even if it sucks in this movie. But why is the chosen topic war and why not skip all that lousy plane thing, just make another movie about nice nature and love?<br /><br />And why, oh why did director do strange attempts at discussing something serious, like racism, social classes, mourning, war refugees, etc? Either one of them... failed miserably.<br /><br />It's simply difficult to blame a movie for being bad if it's actually idiots' fault who made it.\n",
      "What a shame. Rife with historical inaccuracies, and mired with a phony love subplot, this movie misses the mark on many levels. The screenwriters should had based their story more on \"Falcons of France,\" written by Charles Nordoff and James Norman Hall (famous later for writing Mutiny on the Bounty), about their experiences training and then flying for the French in the famous Lafayette Escadrille. This narrative is rich in detail and there would have been plenty of room for cinematic development. Instead, we get a superficial treatment, with flying in the fight sequences that ignore the laws of gravity and physics, and most amazing, all the German pilots are in Fokker D1 triplane, a type of aircraft not introduced to the war until April, 1917, and most of these planes are depicted in red paint, the color used nearly exclusively by Baron Manfred von Richthofen! The writers did manage to get some things correct. Abdul Salis plays a character based on the real person of Eugene Bullard, the first African-American combat pilot. Bullard enlisted in the French Foreign legion at the start of WWI, and after being wounded at Verdun in 1916, he transferred to the Lafayette Escadrille. The commander of the squadron, Captain Georges Thenault, is correctly named and well played by Jean Reno. The squadron did have a lion as a mascot named Whiskey (the other lion cub was named Soda).<br /><br />I think that more could have been done with the portion of the movie dealing with pilot training. The description of the \"Penguin\" roller trainers in Nordoff and Hall's book was very droll, and it would have made a good sequence for the film.<br /><br />The aerial sequences are very well done (in CGI) and as long as you don't pay any attention to the lack of real flight dynamics, the fights are exciting to watch. The finale, a set piece battle involving the squadron against multiple Fokker D1s and a Zeppelin, was very exciting. If the rest of the film was done in such a tight, well paced manner, it would have been much more fun to watch.\n",
      "I didn't care for the music, which looked as if it were going to be a dominant component of this movie. I stuck with it a little, though, and I'm really glad: Pat O'Brien is very funny as a variation on Oscar Jaffe from \"Twentieth Century.\" He's demanding and devious. When crossed, he faux-accidentally breaks a watch he tearfully says was given him by his late mother. Toward the end of the movie, thought we already know it is a ruse, he does this and his secretary -- Penny Singleton in mousy costuming -- says his mother is on the phone. And she wants a tip on the next race at Saratoga.<br /><br />John Payne as the bandleader is OK. The rest of the cast is OK. Jimmie Fiddler plays himself, in a sizable role and that's a nice touch.<br /><br />The writing is the star here, though. And it is a great role for O'Brien.\n",
      "The friends Donald made in Saludos Amigos send him several gifts for his birthday. Eventually he hooks up with Joe Carioca and Panchito and they sing the title song before the film turns into a song filled series of travel stops.<br /><br />Over the years I've watched this movie in pieces as the bits showed up on various Disney shows and compilation tapes but until recently I never watched the entire movie together. I had heard that it was quite good. Unfortunately who ever told me it was good never really watched it or hadn't seen it in years.<br /><br />The problem for me is that after a good opening segment of cartoons about birds the film becomes a music and dance fest. Joe Carioca and we get a song on Baia. When Panchito shows up we get surreal animation and some musical travels through Mexico. Its nice but any hope of it being anything more than \"music video\" is washed quickly away. Perhaps its just a dislike for the images that have been married to some nice songs, but I really don't like this movie.<br /><br />The mixture of live action and animation doesn't really work. Disney had been doing that sort of thing for twenty years prior to the release of this film and I expected more. Mostly the problem is that once the animated characters leave the foreground they look like badly done rear screen projection with all the color washed out.<br /><br />If you must see this, rent it. Actually rent it for the first half, but be prepared to dislike the second.\n",
      "Sort of like an extended Three's Company sketch, except made in the 1930's, 'Misbehaving Husbands' stars Harry Langdon as an overworked oaf who forgets his anniversary and winds up working through the surprise party is wife has organized. What's worse, he gets caught in silhouette with a department store mannequin by some town gossips who are on their way to the party. Soon, rumors spread like wildfire, and one complication leads to another until the wife wants a divorce! This is all put together very nicely, thank you very much, and Harry Langdon does his befuddled Benny Goodman impersonation quite well. There's a few laughs here and there, but this is nothing extraordinary.\n",
      "Though there are some sporadically nicely shot scenes and of course an interesting score by Ennio Morricone, this movie doesn't offer anything new or interesting to the genre. The story is all over the map, too much so. You also get the impression it was written while the film was rolling; it's too fragmented and there isn't any character to identify with. There is also a blatant lack of suspense and there's nothing really thrilling or frightening occurring on screen. Essentially though watchable, there's nothing really compelling to follow. The \"explanation\" thrown in at the 11th hour is slightly ridiculous and too complicated and nonsensical for it's own good. I guess the best that I can say is that it's certainly an interesting mess but by no means compulsory viewing.\n",
      "Either I wasn't paying enough attention or the plot was too smart for me, but I just couldn't understand what was going on in this movie most of the time. Problem is, it's not good enough in other aspects to warrant a second viewing by someone just to get everything straight. Long, muddled and unengaging. (*1/2)\n",
      "- After you've seen giallo after giallo, you begin to think you've seen it all as far as a convoluted plot goes. But then you stumble upon Autopsy. It's got to be the King of the Bizarre Plot. I'm not going to even attempt to go into it in detail because it's so twisted and things come out of left field that I could never do it justice. Just try to enjoy it for what it is.<br /><br />- But the plot isn't where the majority of my problems with Autopsy lie. Instead, I have a real problem with the cast - specifically Mimsy Farmer as the female lead. Unlike Suzy Kendall in Torso or Edwige Fenech in All the Colors of the Dark, Mimsy Farmer and her character are not sympathetic figures. In order for a giallo to work and work well, the viewer must care about the characters who are in danger. I felt nothing for Mimsy. In fact, I was hoping she would be killed off very early in the movie.<br /><br />- Other things I didn't care for were Mimsy's visions of the morgue patients moving around. It didn't really serve much of a purpose and didn't really go anywhere. Also, the director's decision to show up-close shots of solar flares over and over was totally unnecessary. Again, it didn't really serve much of a purpose and didn't really go anywhere.<br /><br />- There are a lot of good gialli to track down if you're new to the genre. Autopsy, unfortunately, isn't one of them.\n",
      "Armando Crispino's \"Autopsy\" begins deliciously enough with a two minute montage of solar flares and grisly suicides over the orgasmic moaning of a woman. We then find ourselves in the city morgue where we're introduced to the protagonist - a young, beautiful (is there any other kind?), and bra-less forensic pathologist (Mimsy Farmer) - who begins hallucinating that the mutilated bodies of the suicides are rising from their slabs. Regrettably, the remaining eighty-eight minutes illustrate that Crispino didn't have a clue what to do next. The stylish and intriguing opening is a bait-and-switch to lure us into a substandard drama about family blackmail, treachery, murder, and the 70's mindset that all a troubled woman really needs to feel better is to be roughed up and screwed. Farmer, who spends most of the film in shirts opened to her naval , is a sexually repressed woman who teams up with a priest with a past (again, is there any other kind?), to investigate the apparent suicide of his sister, and together they uncover a scheme about... well, I'm not really sure. There is lots of gratuitous nudity, bad dubbing, and lousy foley. Don't bother.\n",
      "I tried to watch this movie on VHS years ago, but found it too boring to get through. I decided to give it another chance in a real theater, because I'd heard that it's such a classic. It definitely improved on the big screen (well, not that big), but the good things about the movie are undercut by the unsatisfactory story. The film starts out like a biting social comedy, on the order of \"La Ronde\", but strangely changes tone partway through, turning much darker. But because of the light opening, the characters are not three-dimensional enough to support a serious story. The actors, especially Darrieux, are good enough that they almost make it work, but they needed a better script. The abrupt, unexplained ending was especially frustrating to me. <br /><br />The film is beautifully shot, but the camera-work was a little too hyper for me in places--a dance sequence made me literally dizzy. (Probably most people wouldn't have a problem with that.) Also, the rich, somewhat claustrophobic production design showed a few too many 1950's influences for my taste. <br /><br />On the positive side, I admired the way Ophuls created (on the surface) a believable world of the rich, and yet had an awareness of the poorer people that surrounded it. That was something I did not expect.\n",
      "Sorry people, but I really hated this movie. I found it dull and I found the characters incredibly banal. It's not unprecedented. I also disliked Ophuls La Ronde, made three years before this film. The next time I want to see a well made French romance, I'll go slumming with Rene Clair. And, people, the next time I say I want to see a movie, and you know that there is a climactic pistol duel, kindly tell me to avoid that one.<br /><br />I have no sympathy for Madame de, none whatsoever. If I were her husband, I too would have cheated on her. I mean, we're supposed to judge him for having a mistress, but when Madame de cheats on her husband, we're supposed to find it romantic? Only in movie logic. She apparently goes off with Vittorio de Sica's character because she finds her husband boring and inattentive. Who would attend to her? She's utterly brainless herself? What does she have to offer? Nothing besides breasts. All of my negative judgement was concentrated on her, and, while I wasn't strictly allowed to sympathize with her husband, I tended to, anyway. I mean, yeah, Vittorio de Sica is a stud. I agree totally. He deserves a better mistress than Madame de. Think about it: if she were married to De Sica, life would be just as dull and she'd probably be cavorting with Monsier de. I can recognize the great camera work, and there are a couple of fantastic moments. A dance that fades into another dance, a letter torn to bits transforming into snowflakes. Beautiful moments. Too bad they were in the wrong movie. Someone should steal them. 4/10.\n",
      "This was yet another weak video game based anime like Fatal Fury. The plot had more cliches per minute than almost any other anime I have seen. The animation varied from really quite nice to absolutely terrible. Even the action sequences boring. Only watch this movie if you really have nothing else. I give it a 3.\n",
      "Okay, this is a rather bad movie. I'm sorry, it just is. However, it's hilarious in that way! Anyways, on with the plot/summary. The big action hero \"John Blade\" is a cop, and he's one of those \"mean\" cops but does it to be nice (you know). And then there's the evil corporation, SiNtech. Which, apparently no one thinks they are evil... Even though they are called SIN and they operate out of a GIANT EVIL looking black TOWER. So it turns out SiN is making crazy monsters to take over the world, and of course Blade is the only one who can stop them. Also, all the other cops are apparently on SiNtechs side, so there. ANYWAYS, this movie is worth watching for the lines \"cut him off!\" (sounds hilarious) and my all time favorite dialog exchange that goes something like this... \"Your hand's cold... Why is it like that\" \"Well you know what they say.\" What do they say? They don't tell you, the next line does not allude to it at all. I personally know of no such phrase... Any help is appreciated. One last little observation, all the cars/planes/what-have-you belonging to the cops are all marked 66. Probably making it hard for them to contact each other...<br /><br />I personally have not played much of the game this is \"based\" on, but I'm sure it is not as bad as this was. Good for a laugh if you have a few friends and are REALLY tired (seriously). This movie is just over-the-top, but in a ludicrous way, things happen that don't make sense, and not in the \"smart\" or \"scary\" or \"cool\" way, in the \"what the f... HAHAHA!\" way.\n",
      "One of the dumbest animes I've seen, ever. And one of the worst movies overall to boot. Not as bad as \"Dude, where's my car?\" but that's probably only because this one is quite short (the only redeeming quality of the movie).<br /><br />Stupid \"plot\", boring animation, horrible voice overs and bland action. Not the best recipe for a successful anime in my book.<br /><br />Avoid.\n",
      "This has got to be the worst anime I have ever seen, and I've been watching all the anime I could get my hands on for the better part of a decade. The animation was smooth, but poorly drawn and unimaginative. The narrative of the story had no logical progression, it was just a bunch of cliched action movie scenes played in a random order.<br /><br />There are no real characterisations, yet parts of the movie hinge on the depth of the characters.<br /><br />The funny part is that I hired this because it was based on a game I'd played years earlier that had a great story and great characters! Whahappen?<br /><br />Neither the English or Japanese dub matches the characters mouths - always a sign of something thrown together too quickly.<br /><br />I reiterate, THIS IS THE WORST ANIMATED FEATURE OF ANY DESCRIPTION THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN. I want that hour of my life back.\n",
      "I haven't checked my reviews for all the other Crime Doctor films, so I hope I haven't said any of the rest of them were worst in the series. But, I think after finally seeing this film (the final one for me to see), I can safely say it's the worst. Now this doesn't mean it's a terrible film--heck, this is a generally nice B-movie series--but its standards are noticeably lower than the other films in the series.<br /><br />Warner Baxter returns as 'Dr. Ordway'--a psychiatrist who specializes in criminals and forensics. He's very much the smart and likable guy, though oddly, in this film he seems to be \"made of money\"--throwing around money like a millionaire. He never did this in other Crime Doctor films and spends money haphazardly. Sure, it only amounts to $700--but that's a huge sum of money for 1945. In one case, he buys a painting by an unknown artist sight unseen for $200 and later in the film he pays a man $500 for information that he was willing to give Ordway for free!! I really think Ordway was the one who should have been consulting a psychiatrist!! However, this is only a minor gripe about the plot. The biggest problem I have is how confusing and convoluted it all was. Plus, in the end when you find out who the real murderer is, it really makes no sense at all--nor does his bizarre statue in the basement. In fact, the whole thing makes my brain hurt despite a good performance by Baxter despite being given a script written by pre-schoolers.\n",
      "I'm a passionate advocate on behalf of German Expressionist films, especially from the silent era. I'm still bitter about an incident at the 1982 World Science Fiction Convention in Chicago, when an audience full of idiots (jaded by high-tech S/FX movies) laughed at the cardboard sets in 'The Cabinet of Dr Caligari'. Those morons didn't care that the high degree of originality and imagination in 'Caligari' more than made up for its tiny production budget.<br /><br />'Shadows', however, while firmly within the Expressionist genre, is too arty for its own good. While this film does have some merits, its flaws greatly outnumber and exceed its merits.<br /><br />All the actors perform their roles with hand-to-brow histrionics of precisely the sort which have given silent-film acting a bad reputation. Several of the actors in this movie have given good performances elsewhere, so I assume that director Arthur Robison deserves the blame for their mannered theatrics here. During one scene, when a swain aims a punch at his rival, the actor cannot simply throw a punch: he must put his fist up against the other man's face, and then shove.<br /><br />Alexander Granach, as a showman with a shadow box and shadow puppets, demonstrates some extremely deft hand shadows, apparently with no other props supplementing his hands. But, when the puppet-master isn't performing, Granach lurches across the screen like Igor the hunchback. Ruth Weyher is pretty and graceful but is given no opportunity to behave like a human being.<br /><br />This silent film was originally released with no intertitles. Several other silent features also eschewed captions -- 'The Last Laugh', \"The Old Swimmin' Hole\", 'The Last Moment' -- but those films had linear plots which the audience could easily follow. The plot of 'Shadows' is deeply confusing, made even more confusing by the arty pretensions, and the story would have been far easier to follow with some captions. A curator at the Murnau Archiv has told me that 'Shadows' was given intertitles by several exhibitors when it was released outside Germany.<br /><br />The plot -- such as it is -- vaguely reminded me of Renoir's 'Rules of the Game' and Bergman's 'Smiles of a Summer Night': in a swank country manor, some people with more money than sense amuse themselves at each other's expense. But here the cast members are introduced in arty tableaux that are more alienating than edifying. After the final tableau, we're treated to the odd spectacle of a single upraised finger casting a shadow on the screen. What does this mean, please? Later, in hindsight, we understand that this signifies the beginning of the drama's Chapter One. (I saw this film in London, where the audience burst out laughing at the start of Chapter Two, symbolised by a hand with TWO upraised fingers: in Britain, this two-fingered gesture has obscene connotations.) The finger device is confusing, and adds nothing to the story ... nor does the decision to divide the narrative into arbitrary chapters.<br /><br />The production design is impressive: judging by the furniture and clothes, this story takes place somewhere in Europe (probably Germany) circa 1830: again, some titles would have helped. But Robison considerably weakens the effect of these wonderful costumes and sets by obscuring them with elaborate shadows, and by gimmicky effects such as raising and lowering a proscenium curtain in front of the actors. (As if we need to be reminded that this very artificial story is merely a story!) <br /><br />Considerable talent, effort and expense were put into 'Shadows', to little effect. Rather a lot of today's movie-goers are sadly prejudiced against silent films, misperceiving them all to be crude and laughably overacted. Sadly, 'Shadows' is precisely the sort of movie which would convince such people that all the negative stereotypes about silent movies are true after all. My rating for this failure: 2 out of 10, mostly for the production design.\n",
      "I've seen many slow movies in my days. Some of them are among my favorites (Stalker, I You He She, etc.). However, this movie is so boring it has to be seen to be believed. Actually, ignore that--don't waste your time. This movie was so ridiculously boring that I fast forwarded through the sex scenes. Terrible, terrible stuff.<br /><br />There is zero plot, nothing interesting happens, the acting is, well, uninteresting (how can one comment on the acting it takes for characters to sit in a car or have sex). It truly has nothing to recommend it except for some nice scenery--and any movie that's not a nature documentary that has me commenting on the scenery (especially a movie where the main couple is naked for 40% of the film (no, that's not the scenery I meant)) doesn't have anything going for it. <br /><br />Do yourself a favor and avoid this one.\n",
      "POSSIBLE SPOILER (If further spoilage is possible) It should take longer for directors to go into decline. A great disappointment after Pola X. He got much more out of Golubova in that film --- maybe her characterization, such as it is, and ultimate fate, in 29 Palms reflects a deterioration in their relationship. <br /><br />Contrary to many comments, the dissatisfaction is not about the slow pace  we still love L'Avventura, Bergman, etc., but when there is nothing to look at in the frame, things become very boring. Narcissists are boring, and neither the director nor the actors (nor the Hummer) show us any complications of interest. It may be news to this French director that the California desert is harsh, the roadside strip malls soulless, but it shouldn't be news that sex can be soulless. No, I don't expect the director to make it erotic, but he shows nothing new about sex or violence to those of us over 10 years old. <br /><br />Some have called this a horror film. Is it the horror of kitsch, of Disneyland, of TV,celebrity culture, of corporate America, of present day politics? Seen it all before. The horror of nothingness?: Been done much better before. This film telegraphs the upcoming horror leadenly --- 15 minutes into it I thought \"Deliverance.\"\n",
      "Not shocked. Not surprised. Not unable to get it. This is genuinely a mediocre cinematic work. A hopeless film empty of any respect for the dignity of the human being. Many shots of the beautiful So. Cal. desert as contrast to a meaninglessly horrific/pathetic humanity. A base (I would use the word puerile if the content weren't so explicit) view of humanity. The pacing of the film is rather art-school generic. The framing of the shots is unexceptional, their beauty lying in the landscape not the direction nor the cinematography. A poorly made film despite my opinion of the content. Comparisons to horror films are appropriate as a reference to quality. All 'shock', no content (well, not quite, Joshua Tree National Park is beautiful). Watch as you will. Peace.\n",
      "It's not even enough to blame this on warped French sensibilities. There is no movie here - no plot, no story, no theme, no characters, no cinematography, no soundtrack - just boring shots of the desert inter cut with boring shots of awkward sex - until you finally and mercifully get an ending that is apparently from a different movie entirely. I think it must be a perverse joke by the director - some kind of statement on the absolute banality of our lives if we are willing to sit through something like this - and the fact that the best we can hope for is a violent end to our empty existence. The director should never be allowed to touch a camera again in his life.\n",
      "sorry people: no amount of pseudo-intellectual drivel can justify the dog's breakfast. a horror movie with no actual horror? that's not experimental, that's crap. whoever said movies about images and not story is totally, completely, wrong. Paintings are about images. Movies are about story, plot, characterisation...these things a movie make. if images are your thing, go to a gallery. don't try and excuse self-indulgent cinematic vomit. this film takes an hour and a half for nothing to happen; when it does, it's out of the blue, out of context and out of proportion. the preceding ninety minutes do nothing to build suspense, they are merely boring. nothing about the characters is explained, no back-story is given, and when the inevitable violence occurs, it's relief to know that these two examples of human excrement will not disgrace our screens further. i want my two hours back. rapid painful death to those who drive hummers.\n",
      "Yes, reading the reviews is much more rewarding. By any measure.<br /><br />This review contains spoilers. Read further anyway. It doesn't matter, even when you're intending to see the movie.<br /><br />The film begins with two people in a SUV, David and Katia, driving to the Joshua Tree Desert. Despite all their misunderstandings, they feel attracted to each other, but regularly explode in quarrels and fights. That part of the film was logical and understandable. The film is a study in how relationships can go haywire. One can have look at what they talk. Or you could listen to the silence when they should talk. In your mind, you could even speak up for them when they fail.<br /><br />But why did they cut away the entire character development? Really, I could not care less about David and Katia. What they said and how they behaved was in the end meaningless. In contrast, I rather enjoyed their nude bodies, their physical exercise and the wonderful landscape of the Joshua Tree Desert. Wow.<br /><br />The film ends with three hillbillies tailgating them on a desert road, stopping them, pulling them from the car, and raping David. Why and WHY did this happen? Out from the nothing, the film ends with a sudden conclusion, and you'll never get to know why they were targeted.<br /><br />It has been said that Bruno Dumont, the director of this film, translated a life-negating state of mind into a film. David and Katia were already outcasts in the beginning - he speaks only English and French, Katia only Russian and French - and they were rejected by the desert, a place where you have to rely on your fellow human beings in order to survive.<br /><br />\"Twentynine Palms\" is an ill-fated parable. I don't say Bruno Dumont is a bad filmmaker. But as a filmmaker, he forgot to counterbalance the philosophical, psychological and the tardiness parts with a credible and suspenseful story.\n",
      "If you put a video camera in the hands of someone with little experience who has no idea what to photograph and why, you might come up with an effort similar to \"Twentynine Palms.\" There's nothing wrong with allowing development of a film to take its own course. Some interesting results may emerge in the hands of an experienced photographer who understands his subject matter, has a good eye for composition, lighting, and action, and who is a genuine artist attempting to communicate something about the human condition to his audience. That goal is not achieved in this film, which the director pretentiously advertises as some sort of minimalist artistic enterprise investigating \"the myths of America.\" One might be reminded of \"Deliverance,\" but that movie attempted a grander subject involving not only the dark side of human nature but Nature, itself. We see here a supposed photographer who painfully tries to evoke John Lennon and who with his French/Russian girlfriend attempts to explore the Mohave Desert in Southern California, supposedly scouting locations for a future shoot but strangely without any cameras along (some photographer he is). He's specifically interested in a section of the desert that is reputed to have some real nutjobs roaming around looking for trouble (a few of whom hail from the local Marine Corps base). Despite the stringing together of numerous interminable takes, nothing of interest happens and the setting is not particularly inspiring, largely because the director doesn't seem to know where or when to shoot his indulgently wasted footage. The couple \"enjoys\" several sexual interludes in their motel room, in the dumpy motel pool, and in isolated places out in the middle of the desert. They drive around in his brand spanking new Hummer, the wheel of which he turns over to his silly girlfriend rather casually. Ultimately, their pointless wandering gets the two of them into a real pickle because they are doing it in a potentially dangerous place with no way of defending themselves. When they are bushwhacked out in the middle of nowhere and he is brutally dealt with by three wayward scuzbuckets who strangely leave her almost unscathed, we can't develop too much sympathy for him because he's a jerk who has been sexually exploiting her the entire time. We can't develop much sympathy for her, either, because she's obviously nuts and has been acting out at the slightest pretext over the course of this boring non-story. But when she saves his life and he responds by assaulting and brutally killing her before killing himself, we are left with even less than we had before, which is a big fat zero. The shocking conclusion has obviously been tacked on just as the gratuitous sex scenes were, to make something from nothing with minimal effort. This movie didn't have to be made, probably shouldn't have been made, and hasn't added anything to our appreciation of the new French cinema, much of which is brilliant, beautiful, innovative, subtle, and artistic. If this director would like some lessons on how to use all the money he obviously has at his disposal to far greater effect in the American milieu, I'd be happy to lend a hand. He certainly could use it, and frankly, were I employed by the Customs Department, I'd be going over his case with a jaundiced eye. The guy appears to be more than a little twisted.\n",
      "It must have been a small-budget film and it shows. Sort of a travelogue with sex and violence, it meanders along the byways of Jumbo Rocks and Twentynine Palms, California.<br /><br />Impressive, dignified scenery, and that's about it. Katia plays Katia, who speaks only French. David plays David, who speaks English and some French that falls just short of execrable, which is to say very much like my French. From some angles she looks a bit like Michelle Pfeiffer and from some angles he resembles Harry Dean Stanton. It's difficult to comment on their acting because, aside from some memorized exchanges, it seems that most of the time the director simply aimed the camera their way and said, \"Okay, make something up.\" There's a good deal of playful poking and laughter, like that in John Cassavetes' films. People chuckle and giggle because they can't seem to think up anything else to do.<br /><br />The couple has squabbles and sex. The reasons for the squabbles? Let's see. He looks at another woman in a cafe. He buys her ice cream and asks if she likes it. \"C'est bon,\" she replies, then, \"Pas bon.\" (He sulks because she contradicts herself.) He hits a dog while driving the Hummer because she's blocking his window. Another argument, a serious one, occurs when she locks herself in the bathroom for reasons unexplained.<br /><br />Is there sex? Yes, there is sex, simulated, and a lot of nudity. I had a sneaking suspicion that Katia and David weren't even married, yet here they are, stripping off in the desert, revealing themselves in all their hairy, angular, bilaterally symmetrical splendor. They lie on abrasive rocks, spreadeagled shamelessly. A couple of airliners pass overhead and any passenger who wanted to could look down on them from 37,000 feet and watch them rut and squirm like two javelinas. They don't care. They fornicate on rocks, in swimming pools, and in motel rooms. Oh, and speaking of animals, when David has an orgasm he makes more noise than Katia, although, to be sure, both of them overact in these scenes like porno superstars. What repugnant physicality.<br /><br />The movie drags along for quite a while and when the climax comes we are totally unprepared for it. I don't know whether to get into it or not. I don't think I will, except to say that the scene seems to have been brought in from another movie entirely, some kind of slasher flick with a title like \"Blood and Cactus\". The heavies seem to be either Marines or skinheads, maybe both. The final episode of violence takes place for reasons that escape me completely.<br /><br />Maybe I missed something. Could it be that life is like a road? It has its asphalt pavement and its potholes? Occasional stop signs? Long waits while indifferent freight cars rumble slowly through the crossing, sometimes stopping completely? And at the end you have a fatal traffic accident? This is a French movie so maybe I used the wrong national heuristic. The point of a French film might be that there is no point. That's the whole point.<br /><br />In the end I found the film kind of sad. Not just because of what happens to Katia and David, but for reasons the producers probably never intended. At the beginning the couple stare in awe at acres and acres of energy-generating windmills arrayed across the desert. They find it splendid. I didn't. The ivory sand is dotted with Joshua trees and creosote bush, and littered with flowery paper wrappers, glittering aluminum cans and empty shotgun shells. The Hummer matter-of-factly passes a pile of half a dozen huge, black, discarded tires. If you fly into LAX there are days when you can see the smog as far inland as Twentynine Palms. The point I took away from the film is that if you treat a natural landscape as a garbage dump it becomes a garbage dump sooner or later. A desert ecosystem is a fragile one and, like a human life, can only take so much abuse before it is destroyed.\n",
      "Come on... I watched Flandres before and thought it was pretty pretentious and halfhearted in his artsy approach but I could watch it... quite the opposite to Twentynine Palms which I could hardly watch without staring at the fast forward button of my remote control. This artsy production by Bruno Dumont is a joke of a movie and I can't believe anyone nominates stuff like this.... I get it, its not entertainment... its art, its a giant metaphor of lives endless repetitions, right? Thats why the movie is so damn boring in its 2 hours of nothingness, thats why the couple starring this movie is regularly fighting and having make up sex. Thats why EVERYTHING in this movie is depicted in atrocious repetitions or slow motions of random acts... the totally unerotic sex scenes with mechanistic thrusting and overacted orgasms that border between joy and pain? Is the sex a metaphor for the relationship of the 2 thats about as borderline? Or is it all just a metaphor for life itself? Or does it mean absolutely nothing and all those interpretations (I liked the one about Anti-americanism... thats even more insane than this idiotic movie that makes me ashamed of being European) are based on the great nothing that this movie is? And does Dumont have any problem with sex to paint such a bleak, boring, repetitive and at times rather disgusting picture? Is the knifing in its receptiveness and phallic metaphor with the ridiculous screaming that equals that of Davids orgasms not as cheap as the ridiculous and random rape scene? How often do you have to make a point that even the rape looks like it hurts the rapist more than ole David with his pants down?<br /><br />Sorry, if you subject the audience to 120 Minutes of nothingness and then pound them with repetitive metaphors, pack all this with the same repetitive music (so what does it mean they listen to the same song throughout the movie when driving in their hummer ... ah, the same as the rest of this repetitive metaphor??) and a cinematography that couldn't make me care less... if these pictures are beautiful like some state everyone can feast on beautiful mountainscapes... besides the landscape this movie is ugly and lacking any beauty whatsoever. This is torture and the kind of self absorbed pseudo-elitism that makes me hate the word art. I guess Dumont sees himself as an artist and thats why it all feels so wrong, so fake and drenched in the reek of someone desperately trying to be different... and failing. I think this movie can be summed up with the endless train scene in the beginning... its repetitive, its without any beauty, its not entertaining and everyone can put in his own interpretations since an endless shot of a train+windmills must have a meaning, doesn't it? Or does it take endless shots of bored faces to be meaningful... or ugly sex on the border of rape? I don't care... watch irreversible, since that movie is shocking and has stunning cinematography and visuals and keeps your interest and massages your mind (although I think Noe has as little to say as Dumont, but he made a f***n MOVIE!). Avoid this by any means ...\n",
      "Waste of film and time. This is an obscene exercise in the director's misplaced vanity. I have alerted readers to spoilers, but the truth is there is so little action, story line, character development or writing, there isn't much to spoil. A selfish, arrogant jerk goes on a trip with his super needy girlfriend from Russia. They drive the arrogant jerks Hummer through the desert and have sex in various places with the guy having some impossible, skull exploding orgasm every time. This happens continuously for the first 96 minutes of this 113 minute movie. In the last ten minutes they are pulled over by desert-driving thugs, who force them to stop, rape and brutalize the man, while forcing the woman to watch. In the last minute they are both killed and the movie ends. Just awful. I suppose the artsy pseudo-intellectuals will talk about these things I thought the director had included. The stark contrast of the Hummer in the desert. The less than perfect communications between the man and the woman represent the inherent differences of the sexes. And finally, it was not lost on me (no more than getting hit with a sledgehammer), was the male rape by the guy who had the bigger truck and as some king of insane plot thread, the rapist has a similar very vocal orgasm during the male rape. Look, I don't want to intellectualize over some anti-Hummer tirade by the director, but this movie sucked and the panoramic vistas (which some people think is the saving grace of this movie, kind of in the wide open style of Kubrick in 2001,but it simply did not work for me. For example, some of the shots are so wide, you have to scan to find the actors. Anyway, pass on this film, you have an hour fifty two minutes to do better stuff in your life.\n",
      "From start to finish, the most boring film imaginable. You keep waiting for something to happen, but nothing ever does. Michele leads a very boring life, he is the kind of person I would never wish to make the acquaintance of. The film is a typical product of a certain left-wing so-called culture rampant in Italy in the Seventies, of which Nanni Moretti is a leading exponent. One thing puzzles me: why does Moretti so often cast himself as a person named Michele? Take a look at the list of his films! There must be a Michele in his past who left a lasting impression on him, After all, there is no lack of male first names in Italian; why not Mario, Alberto or even Dante?\n",
      "Completely pointless film. At best, too regional for the rest of the world to understand. Nothing becomes clear, the director's intentions, whatever they may be (if any) don't come out. And worst of all: it pretends to be intelligent. What amazes me most is that this being his first film, Moretti was allowed to make a second one. Don't waste your time with this totally obscure film, life is too short!\n",
      "Alright, I just found this game rather bad, and I'm only posting this because I was surprised not to find any other bad comment. And I can't be the only one who doesn't like this game.<br /><br />First of all, graphics and music are fine, but unless they're awful, I hardly care about these when I'm playing a game. The scenarios and music get old after 5 minutes, and you have to stay there for like 10 hours.<br /><br />Some people say no enemies beside Colossus makes this unique, I say it makes it boring and it's just the result of a lazy/cheap design. Even the Colossus are basically all the same, and really easy to defeat. I can't think of a way to make this killing Colossus more diverse, but I just believe it's a bad idea to make a game just about that. Oh wait... is not about that, is about looking for them, yes! For every enemy, you will spend about half hour looking for it, and 3-5 minutes to defeat it. Every part of this quest is plain boring and repetitive.<br /><br />I'm the kind of guy who gets really fanatic with any game and goes around it multiple times, I can't get enough of video games, I never get bored. I must say I couldn't finish this game once. It is the only one game I own, I'm not playing and I haven't finished. And it's 1/10th time consuming of the average game I play... is that boring.<br /><br />And also, the horse is really stupid.\n",
      "In between \"Love Story\" and \"What's Up, Doc?\", Ryan O'Neal sneaked in this minor, forgotten western co-starring William Holden. It's one of those outdoor character studies which critics love to label 'picaresque' (i.e., episodic story of or relating to rascals or rogues). Two Montana cowboys plan to rob a bank and retire to Mexico, but life has other plans. Holden is restrained and easy, O'Neal very awkward, but the main culprit here is writer-director Blake Edwards (of all people), who sets the early pacing at such a slow drag that the picture never recovers. Supporting cast is unusually strong, but no one here is able to do much with this colorless script. ** from ****\n",
      "Blake Edwards must have had a huge ego after the success of The Pink Panther. What else possessed him to try his hand at a genre that was beyond him in so many ways. This film is so self indulgent on behalf of the writer-director, you can almost hear him in every scene praising his brilliance. Brilliant it ain't. Though it looks nice and shows off some beautiful scenery, this film is slow, OVERLONG, unfocused, mostly pointless and very badly acted by everyone but maybe William Holden (still not stellar) and Victor French. Ryan O'Neal is as miserably out of his depth here as Edwards, a performance that never gets off your nerves. Holden basically carries him throughout every scene they share.<br /><br />The story? Almost non existent. Two cow punchers decide on a whim to rob a bank (just about the dullest 25 minute bank robbery in history), then go on the trot to Mexico pursued by two characters played by Tom Skeritt and Joe Don Baker who really have no character development and have not much to do with anything. Along the way we're treated to endless tedious ambling over hill and dale and slow motion sequences that give you bad Antonioni flashbacks.<br /><br />Forget the positive comments on here, this is one of the worst westerns you'll ever see unless you don't mind being bored senseless. Edwards has made a hash of most films he's directed (SOB and Victor/Victoria excluded), but this has to be one of his three worst. Ford or Peckinpah he isn't. A disaster all the way around.\n",
      "It would be hard to make a film as witless as King Ralph without really trying. It's a shame, because the set-up (gauche, unclassy American takes over the stuffy British aristocracy) has good comic possibilities and Goodman is generally a fun actor to watch.<br /><br />Most of the problems are directly due to the feeble script and weak direction. There are no surprises and none of the comedy set-pieces are handled with any wit or skill.<br /><br />Avoid this film like the plague.\n",
      "The best part about this movie is that we can now all use the movie's title as a clever nickname for fat people. For example, when playing a pick-up softball game back in 1996 Orens stepped to the plate and Baumann yelled from his first base position, \"hey, it's King Ralph.\" This brought great joy to everyone who was lucky enough to hear the comment. That I feel is the greatest contribution of this clearly pathetic movie. I'll admit, I think I rented it when it came out on video, although I was very young so I will assume my mom rented it for me. Anyway, I remember little form the movie, maybe a part where some people get electrocuted during a photo, a potential fox hunt gone sour and a scene with a leader of an African country. I also recall King Ralph being a serious bowler. I do not recommend that you see this movie, however, I do recommend that you call fat people King Ralph for comedic purposes.\n",
      "Oh my God!<br /><br />I've seen a lot of so-so movies with John Goodman in it, but this one is definitely the worse. Thanks god, this wonderful actor later had good opportunities to show us his talent.<br /><br />Such a waste of good actors (Peter O'Toole! John Hurt! Richard Griffiths! Oh no!!) is a shame. The direction is cheap, the script is cheap, the humour is cheap, everything is cheap, this movie is plain cheesy and its \"humour\" is on par with any Benny Hill show. No, really, heeeewwwww!!! David Ward is a honest writer sometimes, but as a director... NO!<br /><br />If you have a brain, avoid this movie. If Benny Hill makes you burst out laughing, then go rent it. Personally, I do have a brain, so it was quite a disgusting experience.\n",
      "King Ralph (1991) is undeniably one of the top five worst films of the 1990's. The script was obviously and only written to cash in on the rise of John Goodman hype & hysteria in the early 90's. Goodman needs to stick to \"Roseanne\" comeback specials, Saturday Night Live appearances, and \"Babe Ruth\" type characters from now on. King Ralph falls short in every possible way because it lacks proper foresight and planning, and the whole title, plot, and idea is quite \"outdated\" even for early 90's standards. This is a cheap rental if you're really, really bored, or just love to watch John Goodman parading around as a goofy King with absolutely no direction in life. I'd recommend \"Brewster's Millions\" with Richard Pryor instead...now there's a comedy that ages gracefully with time...and with a much better cast, plot and vision.\n",
      "Okay, I must admit that I just saw the last half of this movie(I didn't make it in time for the start, as it just went on tv here), so I wont complain much about the movie, as there might be answers to my questions in the beginning of it.<br /><br />I would just like to state that Finland does NOT have an royal family. The names they have used for the Finnish royal family are more typical in Norway/Denmark/Sweden, or at least I think so. (don't kill me if I'm wrong). Another thing is that if they were going to give the Finnish royal family heavy accents on their English, they might have gotten the accents to sound similar to the Finnish language!!! I get to often disappointed by this in American movies. WHY can't anyone just find an accent that is similar to the language they're supposed to talk????!<br /><br />The main thing about this movie I cannot get is how the hell did an American get to be the 'only' one left to the British throne??? My older sister is really into the royal families in Europe, and she just found a list with around 600 (or was it 400?) people who would get the British throne. <br /><br />Since I didn't watch the first part of this movie, I will probably sound stupid now, but was there some sort of an accident.... or several accidents all over the globe since all these people 'suddenly' died and left Ralph from America take over????<br /><br />That would mean that most of the royalties in Europe (not counting the Catholics, as they have no claim for the British throne) were DEAD! Would there then be huge parties in Britain??? <br /><br />There were several things like these that kept me wondering during the movie. When I see something as unrealistic as this, I force myself to look at the whole movie as a big joke. NO ONE CAN BE THAT IGNORANT! <br /><br />other than that, the movie was fairly ok. The singing/playing/dancing act of King Ralph was great, as I love that kind of music. <br /><br />if you want to see this movie, watch it for fun, please don't watch it to look into the monarchy of ANY country, especially not Finland, which doesn't even have one!\n",
      "This straight to video film when I was young was quite good because it went back to the original style of Scooby-Doo the TV series. The only thing that could put it down a bit was the songs. Scooby and the gang get lost and end up in a desert village outside a alien spotting station. Aliens are starting to appear and the gang decide to investigate. During the process Scooby and Shaggy fall in love with Crystal and Amber (a golden retriever). In the end (suprise, surprise) they find out the aliens are three people at the alien spotting station secretly digging for gold. They also find out there are real aliens, Crystal and Amber! Scooby-Doo was number 8 on The 100 Greatest Kids' TV Shows, and he was number 49 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons. Worth a look!\n",
      "Fellini is for people who drink excessive amounts of coffee. (And if you're sitting there saying, \"I drink coffee but not excessive amounts of it\", you're deluding yourself.) Fellini is for people who would like to make the world a better place, but they don't know how, so they just avoid it and concern themselves with the absurdity of life. And drink more coffee.<br /><br />When watching Fellini films I am infected with a violent desire to throw popcorn at the screen and quote Bruno Kirby from _When Harry Met Sally_ in the scene where he's frustrated at Sally's inability to convey her ideas while playing a game of Pictionary: \"Draw SOMETHING resembling ANYTHING!!!\"\n",
      "The Duel at Silver Creek refers to the place where the final confrontation between the good guys led by Stephen McNally and Audie Murphy and the bad guys headed by Gerald Mohr. <br /><br />Mohr heads a nasty group of bad guys who go around shooting hard working prospectors after they've signed over their claims. One of them is the father of gunfighter Audie Murphy.<br /><br />Marshal Stephen McNally is also on their trail, but he's slowed up by a gunshot wound that's left his trigger finger a might unsteady. He turns to Murphy as an ally of convenience.<br /><br />There's a lot of action in The Duel at Silver Creek even more than the usual Audie Murphy western. Unfortunately it's to cover up some really serious problems with the story.<br /><br />I don't know about how you would feel, but even to the kid crowd for which this western was clearly intended, when someone shows up with title to those claims it's going to be rather obvious who was behind all the homicides. My guess is that Don Siegel's film got butchered in the editing. In fact you know there's a piece out of it because McNally just all of a sudden shows up in an army hospital being treated for a gunshot wound you never see take place.<br /><br />Susan Cabot plays the good girl with first a yen for McNally and then for Murphy. Faith Domergue is the bad girl, bad as they come in westerns. She's in cahoots with the bad guys and shamelessly flirts with McNally and young gun Eugene Iglesias while all the time she acts as Mohr's moll in a more modern gangster film style. Domergue has the best role in the film, too bad the film itself is so weak.<br /><br />Look for Lee Marvin in a small role as one of the outlaw gang, if you're looking at all at The Duel at Silver Creek. Definitely for die-hard Audie Murphy fans.\n",
      "Well \"Dollar Mambo\" its a weird movie, its kinda of a musical, or experimental film, there is no dialog at all in the whole movie, everything its express through dancing and music. In the other hand the plot its simple, US soldiers invade Panama and they rape and kill a dancer. It was funny seeing roberto sosa dance, the acting its OK, and the music use its fine but in the movie there are a lot of thing that go from strange to beyond weirdness (like a soldier dress as a ballet dancer) but a i guess it was a symbolism. <br /><br />Overall the movie its too \"artistic\" for my taste, it remind me \"Frida naturaleza viva\" another film by the same director.\n",
      "Predictable, full of every soppy sad tragic story you've seen on the soaps. You know who is going to sleep with whom, you know they shouldn't, you know what the outcome will be. You could write the dialogue yourself, if you've ever seen even a week's worth of soap operas. You either want to leave the room, or turn the channel, it's so soppy and predictable. Of course they all turn out to be strong women in the end; it was written during that era. Of course 99% of the men are jerks; it was written during that era. Of course all the women are fantastically beautiful; you wouldn't put up with this movie if they looked like real, every-day women. The saddest thing about the movie is how beautiful Whitney Houston used to be before drugs and her husband ruined her.\n",
      "So I finally got around to watching \"Waiting to Exhale\" on Encore the other night and I don't understand why this became a hit.<br /><br />(Note: spoilers ahead) As far as I can tell, the basic premise of this film is that all men are insensitive, callous and unfeeling; especially towards women.<br /><br />Okay, well and good. That is the storyline? Fine. Men suck, got it.<br /><br />But there is a huge double standard here; two of the women are dating married men and clearly, we are meant to be sympathetic about their plight as they whine and cry about not having \"their\" man with them at night in bed.<br /><br />How about this? STOP DATING MARRIED MEN! Maybe that's your problem in the first place.<br /><br />Now, on the flip side, Angela Basset's character is abandoned by her husband for another woman. Yet, if you pay attention, even this character is not completely innocent. When her husband informs her he is leaving, the things she says makes it clear she's known about his lover(s) for years but ignored his infidelities. Why? Obviously, because he's so wealthy.<br /><br />She liked all the \"stuff\" a little too much to have confronted him about it. Again, she's made her bed here, not as completely as the two who are actively cheating, but still. She spends the rest of the movie being so angry that he left her you never really grow to like her. Strangest of all is the man whose wife is dying of cancer; he sleeps with the Angela Basset character after they run into each other at a bar. With their clothes on, which apparently means it's oh-so-platonic and sweet. Then he writes her a letter months later, thanking her for that night and leading the viewer to believe that when his wife kicks off, he'll contact her again.<br /><br />Did anyone else think this was more than a little sleazy? I would hope if I were dying of breast cancer that my husband wasn't out sleeping around (and I do mean just sleeping) with other women. Sweet, platonic, whatever; I think it's pretty horrible.<br /><br />Bottom line; the characters you're supposed to connect to are unlikable and the ones you're supposed to hate are just pathetic. Not very enjoyable. However, I did give it three stars for the music, which didn't suck too badly and the clothes and style. It's a nice little snapshot of how things looked in '95. And the print wasn't very faded. <br /><br />That's about it, though.\n",
      "WAITING TO EXHALE <br /><br />Waiting, and waiting, and waiting, and waiting... you get the point. \"Waiting To Exhale\", Forrest Whitaker's take on Terry McMillan's popular book, had a rather popular following upon it's release in 1995. It was packaged brilliantly, crossing over into the popular music scene with a blockbuster soundtrack featuring it's star Whitney Houston. However, as Leonard Maltin said it so beautifully, this film ultimately reminds one too much of the easy listening jazz that plays under nearly every scene.<br /><br />\"Waiting To Exhale\" had the potential to be an interesting movie. It features a nice ensemble that manages to have good chemistry while also allowing certain performers to step into the limelight and really dominate certain scenes. Unfortunately, in the end, the movie is a repetitive drone.<br /><br />It tells the story of four African-American females (played by Angela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Loretta Divine, and Lela Rochon) as they struggle to find the men in life that can satisfy there needs. The only problem, in the world of this movie, men are nothing but complete ass-holes who wouldn't know the word \"feelings\" if they looked it up in the dictionary. How can this film possibly go anywhere when it's screenwriters has made men so incredibly unredeemable that nothing can change.<br /><br />For the first 45 minutes, the film is slightly enjoyable. However, as it continues on into it's 2 hour and plus running time... it begins to feel like deja-vu. The women keep putting themselves in identical situations to those they've experienced in the past... and as much as they talk about it in slow/sultry voice-overs, they don't seem to learn squat.<br /><br />It's like the soundtrack music. Slightly soothing, enjoyable, and easy to digest... but too slow and pointless to listen to for very long. \"Waiting To Exhale\" in the end is nothing more then a boringly pointless film that wastes the potential it had with the cast. Were the film given more of a focal point, and a more distinct narrative line, perhaps it could have been a good film. But everyone on board apparently missed the memo that... films are better when they have a plot and a purpose.<br /><br />... D ...\n",
      "This movie is awful! The caracters are shallow and almost ridiculous, especially Lela Rochon. It's a very, very, very bad soap opera. I was watching this movie with my wife and we were laughing almost all the time. It is much too long, with no rhythm with absolutely no emotions. It is only a poor attempt to manipulate the viewer by using one cliché after another. Skip it, it's a waste of time!\n",
      "With all the hype surrounding \"Waiting to Exhale,\" I was looking forward to renting it on video. It's nice to know that someone has made a movie with four strong, independent African-American women. <br /><br />But when I saw it - and maybe this is me ranting because I, being a white male, am not part of the target audience - I was annoyed by all the whining, especially regarding that the men that these women were sleeping with/getting divorced from were leaving them for white women.<br /><br />I can understand them being upset, even furious, with all of the philandering. But they act as if it would be OK if the men left them for other African-American women. Not to make light of the issues of racism, adultery, or divorce, but I can image Bernadine saying, \"Hey, Savannah, I see that you're sleeping with my husband. Care if I join in!?\" (Apologies to those who may take offense).<br /><br />Speaking of Savannah, why is Whitney Houston complaining about finding the right man when she seems to be able to have sexual relations with any man that has matinee idol looks and a job - not to mention is *MARRIED*. I guess that any man who isn't married is a loser to Whitney. <br /><br />Having not read the book, I realize that this is merely an adaptation - or, for Terry McMillan's sake, I hope it is. I'm not knocking any of the acting. Angela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Lela Rochon and Loretta Devine, as well as the supporting cast, are all talented and do commendable jobs. And Forest Whitaker proves himself to be a talented director. It's just that the lion's share of the characters come off as unsympathetic. <br /><br />I realize that I'm merely scratching the surface, but I've wasted enough time on this movie. \"Why Do Fools Fall In Love,\" the movie which describes Frankie Lymon's battles with the recording industry and liasons (sp) with three different women, one of which is Rochon, is a far superior movie and worth at least $5 of the $6 that I paid to see it. <br /><br />I give this one 2 out of 10.\n",
      "This film is simply about a bunch of women who pick men who's behaviors they claim to hate & then spend the rest of their time complaining about them. It seems that this view is held by many women & possibly accounts in some measure to the number of women who consider their relationships with men to be unsatisfying.\n",
      "It had some laughs, but overall the motivation of the characters was incomprehensible. Why should they be mad at men for cheating when they sleep with all sorts of married men themselves? Very hypocritical. Their lives are messed up because they messed them up with stupid choices. I had no empathy for any of these women.\n",
      "Waiting to Exhale is guided thoroughly by a hot soundtrack from beginning to end. It is also complimented by sharply shot scenes and attractive locales. However, much of this is wasted on poor character development. Without likeable characters, this plot sinks quickly and doesn't recover. What should be shown is complex identities that the women have, but instead viewers are shown superficial confusions of the women which makes them out to be dumb and non-rational leading ladies. While the movie is supposed to highlight the women, and have males as supporting characters, the plot so demonized the men that even the \"nice\" men such as Gregory Hines and Wesley Snipes seem entirely out of place and more token goodness than believeable characters. <br /><br />Worst of all, were some vastly misplaced and undesirable scenes, which I honestly hope were either more deeply probed in the book, or not part of the book at all. For instance, why was the fact that Gloria's former man is gay/bi-sexual even remotely important to this script. Clearly the answer is that it isn't. Gloria's character did not need that type of nonsense to provide a background that she could work with. Why the director didn't see this, I don't know.<br /><br />Weak film, waste of acting talent by wonderful actresses like Angela Bassett, and a brutal waste of an excellent soundtrack by Babyface.<br /><br />4/10\n",
      "Angela Basset was good as expected, but Whitney has no Range as an actress. The screenplay also neglected to portray, on film, the greatness of this novel. Instead of promoting sisterhood, they emphasized the canine-qualities of men. Read the book; rent Soul Food instead!\n",

      "This series has its ups and occasional downs, and the latter is the case, here. There's an agreeable amount of spatter, with an inventive implementation of the Baby Cart's weapons, but the editing film is a seriously disjointed, the film-making itself rougher than usual. At times, the action slows to a crawl as the camera follows the wordless wanderings of the \"cub,\" who nearly gets lost early on. All in all, disappointment.<br /><br />That said, there's a spaghetti eastern quality to the music and action that may win the approval of dedicated viewers. This installment spends much of its time following the minor misadventures of the little boy, who begins to stare into the abyss of death his father opened for him.\n",
      "Before I start this review, I must admit that when I saw this movie, it was the wee hours of the morning and I was slightly intoxicated. Maybe my judgment was a little off, but I doubt it.<br /><br />'The Park' is a silly 3D horror movie about a haunted amusement park, which just happened to be built on a cemetery. After several deaths at the park, it was closed down. 14 years later, a journalist investigating the park goes missing (naturally). His sister, Yen, is determined to find him, but their mother, a ghost hunter, believes him to be dead already. Regardless of her mother's professional advice, Yen sets out with a group of ghost fodder (her friends) in an attempt to find her brother.<br /><br />Where to begin with this film's faults? There are so many. For starters, the plot is a mess. Unoriginal and full of plot holes. There is nothing close to horror in this. Sure, there are ghosts and other such dead people, but no scares. The 3D effects on which the film was based weren't all that impressive - or even 3D - on the VCD I watched. The dialog (in subtitles) was rather bad. All the characters seem to have a problem in which they felt the need to state the obvious, with everyone saying several times \"There are ghosts!\". I think they got the point after that was said for the billionth time.<br /><br />I will give 'The Park' credit for two things though: More proof that clowns are evil, and the fact that we have very little (to no) character development. It's a great way to determine early on who will die, and who will survive.<br /><br />After thinking about it, this seemed like it was meant to be campy B-movie. The (very blatant) references to 'Mr Vampire' and 'Nightmare on Elm Street' prove that, but it still felt like the movie was taking itself too seriously. Sure, I laughed at some bad B-movie moments, but those few moments were surrounded by a whole lot of just plain bad material.<br /><br />1/10 - 'The Park' was very disappointing. Maybe I'll try watching it again sometime, but not any time soon.\n",
      "I've watched this movie in my country. It's uttermostly stupid movie. The story is bad, going on without reason. Some scene was copied from Ju-On. And the ghost capture by photo camera idea came from a game.<br /><br />There are some bad 3-D scenes but it's just a cheap and cannot-frighten-you 3-D.<br /><br />It's not worth watching. Try some movie else.<br /><br />I give this movie an F grade.<br /><br />PS. This is just my humble opinion. Thanks!\n",
      "I've seen some dodgy HK movies in my time, but this has to rank pretty highly in the roll-call of stinkers. An unstructured, clumsily-paced mess from start to finish, with little in the way of a plot and so much thunderous noise and self-conscious 'scary stuff' that it never comes close to creating the quietly unsettling atmosphere needed to set up the viewer for a scare. The bargain-basement 3-D effects (a surprise considering CGI-fiend Andrew Lau's involvement) simply don't work on a DVD viewing (and providing only one pair of glasses is pretty cheap!) due to the poor colour balance. I will think twice before snapping up any more gimmicky films from bargain bins...\n",
      "What a waste of time and money. I recently saw this film at the Philadelphia Film Festival and reduced my expectations so that I was only going to enjoy the 3-D effects. Not only was the film a complete mess of bad acting with a terrible screenplay, the 3-D effects were only used for about ten percent of the film, and the effects were barely noticeable, using old red/blue (anaglyph) 3-D technology. It seemed like the film wasn't even filmed to take advantage of the use of 3-D. This replaces Jaws 3-D and Amityville 3-D as the worst 3-D film I've ever seen. Next year at the festival, I'll have to avoid these gimmicky, low-end horror/action films. This film isn't even worth it for the curiosity factor. Stay away.<br /><br />\n",
      "Whoops I forgot my 3D glasses to experience those mind-popping images (where we are informed when to put them on or take them off), but I doubt that gimmick would have saved this already below-average, if bizarre supernatural/slasher tale from Hong Kong. It looks like it had a bit money behind it, but it feels second-rate when compared to others of its field and that ending is a complete wimp out. <br /><br />At least it has going for it some stylish visual brushes by Wai-keung Lau's frenetic direction and an imposingly eerie setting (an abandoned theme park, which has some freaky looking clown dolls on a hanging tree) with some sensational art direction (like the opening entrance of the clown face). Too bad that it's senselessly penned with an messy same-old, same old structure (even though the concept showed more promise than your copy-and-paste 'Ringu' clone) of cheap jolts, typical thrills (that steals its thunder from other films) and lazily constructed characters. Even throughout it demonstrates some unwelcoming camp qualities, where the witless script and self-knowing humour just don't come off. It irritated, but not as much as the performances do. Bobo Chan in the lead role never convinces and her screaming/crying gave me a splitting headache.<br /><br />Yen along with her friends are looking for her missing brother, despite the warning from her medium mother that he's dead. It leads them to an amusement park, which closed down over a decade ago after a horrible accident involving the death of a young girl. Instead of finding her brother they come across restless spirits who pick them off one by one.<br /><br />The computer effects are well-done and never distracting, as there's one memorable decapitation sequence that's brilliantly executed and there's a little bit of blood 'n'gore in the traditional style. Sound effects hold an atmospheric grip, but those constant whooshing noises and whispering voices could've been toned down. The music score wasn't all that effective, even with some jaded cues.<br /><br />Pretty much like a foreseeable, underwhelming haunted house theme park ride.\n",
      "Let me start by saying this movie tries way too hard. What's with the long haired ghost and powder white boy at the start, who have nothing to do with the rest of the movie? I guess it's called pandering to the masses.<br /><br />But seriously, the scares keep coming and coming, but there's one problem. None of them are the least bit scary. Some are unintentionally hilarious, but nothing scary. Considering the greater part of the movie is supposed to be frightening, this is a major flaw.<br /><br />I don't particularly care about the characters either. Sure, they throw in some 5 minute subplots, but none are interesting. The plot is pretty basic as well. I mean, how original is a haunted theme park? There are some positives however. There are one or two death scenes, including a beheading, which are pretty cool. And they managed to find the official ugliest man in the world, who is fun to laugh at.<br /><br />Still, this movie isn't good. Pass it up for other better Asian ghost flicks.<br /><br />4/10\n",
      "Chinese horror film about an abandoned amusement park where a bunch of kids go looking for a missing family member. Years earlier a series of accidental deaths caused the park to close and for people to stay away. It transpires that an evil clown like entity is taking and stealing the souls of the people who died there and holding them.<br /><br />Good looking but unfrightening and dull movie that really isn't worth bothering with. If it wasn't for the fact that the film has some ghost sequences in 3-D this movie really wouldn't have seen any play dates out of China. There has no tension since much of the spooky action consists of the characters stumbling around looking scared while in the dark amusement park with nothing scary happening. This films ideas of scares or interesting ghost imagery is to trot out every long haired and small child ghost cliché and use it. If you've seen Juon/The Grudge/The Ring you've seen it all before.The film also uses people with physical deformity for frightening effect for no good reason other than the film makers have broken through the bottom of the barrel. The clown ghost stuff is interesting but because of lousy 3-D you really don't get a good look at it. Its not even worth discussing the illogic of the plot, its twists, or how good the amusement park looks after being abandoned for so many years.<br /><br />Clearly this is going to be the made just for the cash turkey in director Andrew Lau's closet(he did Infernal Affairs and Initial D among others). <br /><br />Stay away from this, even as a rental.I picked this up in Chinatown for five bucks on DVD and feel I was over charged (and ripped off since the DVD only had one set of 3-D glasses in it- then again the 3-D didn't always work) 3 out of 10.\n",
      "<br /><br />... And this film is good for only that. At an amuzement park a little girl falls from one of the attractions, and dies. This shots down the park, but some year later a boy goes out to the shut down amuzement park. Who he is, or why he really wants to go there, noone knows. He goes missing. Who takes him or why, noone knows. Then his annoying sister wakes up, and decides to go find him. Why noone knows, he´s been missing for quite some time. Who she is? Well she´s the sister ofcourse. She teams up with some friends, and from here on the movie steals from every single film, that the writer could think of. Small kids with dolls, themepark built on cemetary, DV cameras that can record what isn´t there, evil clowns, and a mutant and his son, who´s just basicly up to no good. Oh yeah. It even has a \"Surprising ending\".<br /><br />What a piece of garbage. This and \"Mutant Dog\" must be the worst I´ve ever seen. 1 out of 10.\n",
      "Whichever way you approach this movie, you can't escape the fact that it is downright awful!! Anyone expecting something along the lines of the standout far east films such as the Ring, the Eye, the Grudge etc is in for a massive disappointment when viewing this effort. In fact, it's difficult to find any redeeming features about this movie - storyline is flimsy in the extreme, acting is atrocious, screenplay and script are diabolical and, for a supposed scary film, it just isn't in the least bit scary. In addition, the few 3-D scenes are quite simply not in the least bit 3-dimensional! The whole thing is an utter mess from start to finish, and its 90 minute duration seems more like 90 hours! All in all, a quite dreadful experience!!\n",
      "Why do I find this movie unsuccessful? They pretend to be unbiased, and clearly have a point of view. The filmmaker begins by saying that she really liked Moore and his movies and even his beliefs, but as she attempted to have a meeting with him, during the heat of his crazed Fahrenheit 9/11 press junket, his inability to make time for an unknown filmmaker led her towards the dark side of Moore. The truth is, she set out to film an expose, and failed miserably.<br /><br />It's a shame - all the research, all the interviews, and all the back story would have simply made an entertaining biopic of a larger-than-life man who's actually had an impact. Instead, she magnifies insignificant details of a man's life that demonstrate not Moore's missteps but her own.<br /><br />She tries time after time to show that Moore's films aren't flawless scientific reports on their subjects. Is it a surprise that a film might not be a perfect, exacting list of empirical data? Moore's films have always been under extreme scrutiny, specifically Bowling For Columbine, Fahrenheit 9/11, and now Sicko. Moore is open and honest - he refutes each and every claim of error on his website, backed up with links to the official reports and sources for his information and facts. So the attacks change to \"Yeah, but Moore's film made it SEEM like...\", that his films somehow imply things not offered into evidence. I think everyone's hope is that NOTHING is taken at face value - if it is, the fault is with th ignorant viewer.<br /><br />Much is spent demonstrating that his \"image\" of being poor, hapless, slovenly and angry is manufactured. In fact, as a whole I consider the entire piece to be an ad hominem attack on Michael Moore's work via attacking Michael Moore. It's a logic fallacy tool used by debaters lacking actual evidence.<br /><br />Going back 20 years to the filming of \"Roger & Me\", the filmmakers are unable to find confirmation that Ted Koppel had canceled coverage of a town hall meeting (a quick humorous mention in the movie is that the satellite news van was stolen so Koppel's report couldn't be broadcast live). This movie then goes so far as to convict Moore of actually manufacturing not one, but all elements of the story. There WAS no town hall meeting. No news van. No Ted Koppel report. They even filmed a phony news reported commenting on the town hall meeting, Ted Koppel and the stolen news van. Of course, nobody mentions this in 1989 when the movie is seen and scrutinized by millions. But 20 years later, they can't find evidence so it must be a fraud.<br /><br />In short, the movie fails because it aims an empty gun at Moore and fires repeatedly. Moore is imperfect. He's certainly got a point of view. But he makes great, honest films that serve to enact real change. The casualties are his enemies, not the truth.\n",
      "I don't have particular feelings for or against the work Michael Moore does, so hopefully you won't see this as a pro-Moore attack on naysayers. The arguments and supporting evidence presented are are weak and blown-up, and in most cases hypocritical. A typical example of this is juxtaposing footage of Moore arriving at the Oscars, while nearby protesters demonstrate against the war. Trying to imply that Moore is just a glory-seeking filmmaker who would rather hobnob with celebrities than join in the protest, the point falls flat when you consider how the now infamous acceptance speech made by Moore (and the film itself) did more for the Anti-war cause than a street protest ever could. I am all in favour of films to counterbalance the polemics of Michael Moore, but please don't accuse him of manipulating footage and then do exactly that, adding sinister music. A badly-made film presenting a poorly-made case.\n",
      "I approached this film from the position of being a Moore fan.<br /><br />I use the word \"fan\" loosely here really because while I've enjoyed his documentaries and come away from them believing I'd learned something, I've also had problems with them.<br /><br />Now I don't want to get political here, I'll leave that for others to do. I just wanted to open my review with an honest statement about where I stand with Moore myself.<br /><br />With that said, I felt this movie had far more problems than your average Moore film. I felt it was manipulative and at times, extremely biased. It felt to me like the film makers were just annoyed they couldn't really get any quality time with Moore. I got the distinct impression that Moore was not only aware of this movie but was aware of what the movie was trying to do. Namely, to try and cast a shadow over Moore using the very same techniques they damn Moore for using.<br /><br />It was good that some aspects of why I've always been unhappy with some elements of Moores documentaries were addressed in this movie. Only the gullible believe Moore is unbiased and presenting only truth. However this film fails to satisfy my doubts because it laces the documentary with such bias itself that you cannot extract whats true and what is just purely anti-Moore propaganda.\n",
      "First of all, I have no allegiance to (nor do I have anything against) Michael Moore. This review is as unbiased as can be. I appreciate his films that I have seen, but I rented Manufacturing Dissent with the intention of seeing a thorough counterargument from the other side. What I got was nothing short of childish.<br /><br />There is not a single logical argument presented in this entire film. An argument goes like this:<br /><br />1) If p, then q. 2) p. 3) Therefore, q.<br /><br />This never happens in this film. The entire film is based upon naive associations and assumptions which anyone over the age of 10 should know not to make. For example: Moore is anti-George Bush, therefore Moore is bad! (This is actually suggested in the film. I am not making this up.) To even take this argument *seriously* (much less accept it), you'd have to actually support George Bush. And unless you entirely support George Bush, then you have absolutely no reason to be offended by such an association to Michael Moore! If this sounds ridiculously obvious, that's because it is. And that's how stupid this film is. <br /><br />Another example: Michael Moore is a bad musician, he's fat and ugly, and here's a creepy picture of him with creepy music playing! (Once again, all of these are actually presented in the film.) This, of course, should be an insult to every human's intelligence on the earth. This is just sad. This is nothing less than an 8-year-old attempt at brainwashing/behavioral conditioning. <br /><br />The day after watching this film, I woke up wondering if it was real. At this moment I am looking at a rented copy of Manufacturing Dissent from Blockbuster on my desk...so unfortunately, it is real. And it is possibly the worst documentary of all time.\n",
      "Im not a blind Michael Moore fan by any stretch, in fact I think \"The Big One\" is probably one of the worst films of all time, and I think that he is an annoying blowhard. Being a proud independent, I can see the idiots on both sides.<br /><br />But as Im watching this, I noticed a glaringly ridiculous scene (mentioned briefly by someone else in an earlier review). They showed a group of Flint High School girls doing some sort of irritatingly silly amateur schoolie play that mocks \"Roger and Me\" (the kind that only the mostly blindly adoring of right wing parents would be able to endure in their pompous little brats), and then the teenage girl \"writer\" of this play is interviewed, and she claims that Moore \"fabricated\" a news report that shows a female reporter stating that a Nightline report was cancelled because their news van was stolen, even as the scene from the film with her report is being shown over the girl's claims. It is from all visual inspection a real news report. Is she truly trying to say that Moore literally created the report in the film himself, hiring an actress to pose as a reporter and putting a fake station logo on the screen? If so, its funny because I cant seem to find any mention of it anywhere else but on this site, about this film. Did this little girl just make it up and these idiot filmmakers put it in at face value? Doesn't that make them complete hypocrites (like most people who do these kinds of amateurish no-budget \"gotcha\" documentaries).<br /><br />The female narrator (I assume its a woman named \"Debbie Melnyck\", who is listed as one of the \"writers\" and \"directors\") tries for a parody of Moore's sardonic style, but her lispy, effete elementary school teacher housewifey monotone would be more apt for Romper Room or selling jewelry on QVC. (Maybe the girl who put on the play is her daughter or something.) Sure, Michael Moore is a jerk, but what comes out much more glaringly in this film is the vapidness of young people in the majority of the spineless post-baby boom generations. We're doomed, folks. Face it now and save yourselves the Christmas shock. There's no hope. This documentary is depressingly effective at showing how our nauseatingly effete youth are going to sissy their way into the end times. We're all going out with a whimper, followed by a bang. This film is a good argument in favor of everyone deserving it. Both sides are chock full of fooles. The difference between the swishing grade Z Canadian twits who created this and Michael Moore is, Moore has talent for making films, and they don't. Stay home, Debbie dear, you aren't worthy to speak to Moore for a reason. It's not because he's avoiding you. It's because you are insignificant.<br /><br />This wretched film is showing on Sundance Channel this month, so watch it for FREE by all means, if you must at all (please don't pay people like this to make more films like this). Or better yet, watch a good documentary instead (like \"Grey Gardens\", which is also playing this month on Sundance).\n",
      "I've seen enough anti-Moore information to know that yes, the guy uses manipulative techniques and stretches the truth to fit his points or tell a good story. Unlike other reviewers here who seem to excuse this, I find this absolutely ridiculous, unnecessary and morally repugnant. Also, I totally see that he's a megalomaniac and a blow-hard who cares more about himself than the populist change he preaches. After all, if you're truly fighting \"The Man\" (and not just making entertainment for Lefties), you'd better point a gun that is loaded with facts, not blanks.<br /><br />Given all of this, I still like his stories and find the guy amazingly charismatic. Those who critique him seem to ignore that he is a master at making interesting films, deftly mixing humor and emotion in a way that makes it seem easy. If that skill is being used for good or evil, fact or fiction, is another matter.<br /><br />Whether on the side of justice or malice, I think that the makers of \"Manufacturing Dissent\" don't have an ounce of the ability of Michael Moore. The film plods along, marking off point after point like a laundry list. The editors should be viciously beaten. There's no clear narrative line, just a series of scenes, one after the other. At just over one hour and a half, the film seems long, making the same tired points over and over again.<br /><br />Ultimately, my biggest problem with the film is that it indulges in the same bag of tricks against which it accuses Moore. The documentary is obviously a hack job against the guy, meant to counter his legacy. The footprints of a personal vendetta are all over this film, from the very first minutes. This is fine. In fact, I welcome it. Yet the filmmakers manipulatively use a \"neutral\" and \"unbiased\" style, as if they were simply presenting \"facts.\" Also, they steal Moore's framing device of a failed chance for an interview. This goes nowhere (It's pretty obvious that they wanted to call the film \"Michael and Me\" but settled on the lame \"Manufacturing Dissent.\" At first I thought this was a documentary about Noam Chomsky). Toward the end of the film, they gleefully admit to \"stepping over the line,\" using a Moore tactic to enter one of his press conferences. They then attempt to build sympathy with the audience, appearing shocked and indignant first when they ambush him (What? We're not the center of Moore's universe?) and again when they get caught and kicked out.<br /><br />All of this falls flat, partly because it is done with strident self-righteousness, not the humor and humanity of Moore's own attempts. But it mostly fails because using Moore's manipulative tactics to show how wrong those tactics are is a rather silly thing to do.\n",
      "My curiosity kept me watching this movie on the Sundance channel when I happened upon it. I agree, Moore can be ridiculously melodramatic in his style, but who isn't in regards to the entertainment industry? It includes documentaries, non-fiction. The makers of this, supposed expose, kinda SUCK. It appears they're trying to show that Moore manufactures much of the content in his movies, & they fail miserably. Yes, Moore does make up some crap to get his point across, but that's a standard practice in our wonderful Hollywood, even in documentaries. The points they make in this movie are equal to a high-school student's project, & the grade wouldn't be above a C. Anyone who likes this movie is either a Bush supporter and/or someone who has issues with Michael Moore's character. They're trying to show how Moore manipulates the facts & shapes the story to his own bias. That's scriptwriting 101, \"you morons\"! As if that has not been done throughout the history of film making, of scriptwriting for theater, of authoring books and articles. Yeah people, talk about how pointed & biased Moore is in his movies, & then go & watch the History Channel & say that it's documentaries & history on religion are based completely on NON-DISPUTABLE FACTS. I would consider you the easiest MARKS for any con-man who 'says' that he believes in 'YOUR' God & 'YOUR' Jesus. By the way, I'm wondering, did I see Ann Coulter in 'YOUR' movie? I also agree with many, that Moore can be a little, to a lot overbearing at times. Michael Moore can be grating, unfair in his treatment of others, hypocritical at times, but will those unpleasant flaws about his character cause you to despise and disregard his productions? How about it if everybody watches everything that's produced as NON-FICTION, with a critical eye. It's like a film student watching the business end of Hollywood productions that are on TV or at the movie theaters. Where's the product placements, which of our emotions is the script trying activate, who are the villains, the scoundrels & do the roles they play work at all into the politics of today. Politics are in every aspect of your life. Look around yourself, the war, the price of gas, the 4th amendment, the cutbacks. If film makers want to make a left-leaning director look bad, they need to do a lot better than this movie does! Just making Moore look like an inconsiderate assh*** & then letting those who represent the completely opposing views have their say, while throwing all the trash they can on Moore's work, causes me to suspect whether these film makers were ever truly fans of Moore. I don't think so & the proof is in the pudding & even Don Quixote would say that it tastes horrible. OK Bush devotees, point at my incorrect use of that aphorism, about the pudding. Or was it incorrect? Look up the word, \"aphorism\", in your DICTIONARY, & it starts with the letter A. Or are you like GWB? Is the DICTIONARY, a job for someone else? Oh yes, the \"you morons\" written above is my tribute to Bill O'Riley, which I think is himself talking to himself and his multiple personalities. If only one of them could be intelligent.\n",
      "Strategically timed with the DVD release of \"Sicko\", as is the other Moore-stalking film, \"Michael Moore Hates America\", a wannabe documentary maker cashes in, again using the same \"Fahrenhype 911\" rehash and Albert Maysles ax-grinding as Michael Wilson's film used.<br /><br />It's good for people to remind Moore of any factual errors he needs to improve on, which can be done in an article. As to the film's refrain about Moore's film not being a \"documentary\", Moore has said repeatedly he is not a fan of documentaries, does not watch them and is not trying to make them. People keep putting his films in the documentary category and they win prizes there. <br /><br />So aspiring directors Caine and Melnyk, as with Michael Wilson, latch on to him playing \"gotcha\" to make themselves famous. Melnyk has the camera focus on herself intermittently as she plays \"investigative journalist on the phone taking notes\", then puts forth the message in her film that Moore's including himself in his films is bad film-making. Sour grapes abound from film people interviewed, at least one of whom defames him personally. As with \"Michael Moore Hates America\", the crew follow Moore from place to place for interviews. <br /><br />One would think that the fact Moore was himself making a film (Sicko) the past two years might have entered their minds as a reason he might have been busy, but they take their complaints in with them to his public appearances to paint him as a hypocrite. Moore has brought this on himself to a degree by his \"Roger and Me\" film's style of following Roger for an interview, but in that case it was to try to bring attention to a problem affecting other people. This new crop of directors following Moore are all about manufacturing images for themselves to no particular end since the topic has already been handled in full by Fahrenhype 911 previously.\n",
      "This film accomplishes nothing. Even the tagline is exaggerating, far reaching crap. It should have been: <br /><br />\"Because we're small time and couldn't get an interview- it's never been so hard to get Michael Moore in front of a camera.\" <br /><br />The film shifts tone, focus, and favoritism with each interview or point. What's the big deal with Moore doing the same thing as Republican politicians with their tainted media? It's like fighting fire with fire- you lie, we lie. It's obvious he does it much better than this group of filmmakers trying to ride his coattails- and by the way- they're late. This film should have come out decades ago so it's dated and tired out already. If it had a point to prove, they blew it by waiting decades to state it, because with time facts and footage are lost- so if this films investigators couldn't find facts or footage it must be because Moore was lying...dumb way to prove your point. The only thing this film achieves is letting the audience realize what a bunch of amateurs this group is by comparison to Moore. If you're going to lie, do it well...and for a frigging reason at least. Moore has moved on to other topics, other films, and new focus. This film lives in the past, so there's nothing compelling about it other than a cover design featuring graphic art of Moore as a caricature. <br /><br />LMFAO \"Unbiased\" my ass. They'd be more credible, in my opinion, if they just said this was an anti-Moore film. They're lucky Moore wouldn't waste his time discrediting these hacks, because all this film had going for it is Michael Moore's name. This film has been made before at least twice, so come up with an original concept for once- instead of remaking Republican propaganda that discredits Moore. Instead the filmmakers waste our time telling us something we all know already. It's more about their self- importance and how they're 'worthy' to continue on their journey to discredit Moore. This is a bitter and resentful documentary with jealous undertones and I'm sorry- but they don't have the chops or charisma to win over Moore's popularity. <br /><br />Aren't their more prominent world figures to discredit? Like ones who influence the world because they RUN IT- and not watch it on CNN while eating chips and thinking up conspiracy theories? the man may throw out a lie here or there, but at least he gets his audience to think with a different view or mindstate- unlike this film, which has nothing to say other than: \"we're as good as him\"- which they also are not. <br /><br />sin-surely, <br /><br />RF <br /><br />\"This is me...ya anonymous bitches\" http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=PREVALENTMIND\n",

So the attacks change to \"Yeah, but Moore's film made is SEEM like...\", that his films somehow imply things not offered into evidence. I think everyone's hope is that NOTHING is taken at face value - if it is, the fault is with th ignorant viewer.<br /><br />Much is spent demonstrating that his \"image\" of being poor, hapless, slovenly and angry is manufactured. In fact, as a whole I consider the entire piece to be an ad homing attack on Michael Moore's work via attacking Michael Moore. It's a tool used by debaters lacking actual evidence.<br /><br />Going back 20 years to the filming of \"Roger & Me\", the filmmakers are unable to find confirmation that Ted Koppel had canceled coverage of a town hall meeting (a quick humorous mention in the movie is that the satellite news van was stolen so Koppel's report couldn't be broadcast live). This movie then goes so far as to convict Moore of actually manufacturing not one, but all elements of the story. There WAS no town hall meeting. No news van. No Ted Koppel report. They even filmed a phony news reported commenting on the town hall meeting, Ted Koppel and the stolen news van. Of course, nobody mentions this in 1989 when the movie is seen and scrutinized by millions. But 20 years later, they can't find evidence so it must be a fraud. When a young girl pro Bush was ask if she see the \"Fahrenheit 9/11\" the answer was just great...NO. but I am a sensitive person and I cry when I saw \"Saving Private Ryan\", witch mean: \"I don't know what is about but I know something else and I proud about\"\n",
      "Considering the subject matter, you already know whether you will agree or not with this film. The damage here is how bloody boring the thing is, and how one major interviewee has actually accepted money from Moore to aid his (get ready for it) sick wife that her insurance wasn't covering properly. His name is James Kenefick and the story is on the daily IMDb news feed. Check it out for yourself, but so far all this film proves is that Moore is a charitable human being. As for the rest of it, nothing we haven't heard before from various members of the pretenders to the documentary throne. Just ask yourself why all of a sudden medical industry people are so nervous about Moore. Could it be he has a point? Conservatives get cancer too, and it seems more and more of them are seeing Moore's point enough to cash his check.\n",
      "It was supposed to be a horror, thriller but disappointingly the only horror that occurred was the money I spent for the cinema ticket. The film was so boring with extremely terrible acting, the only good actress was Michelle Rodriguez and the film was watch able because of her but what is the use of having a good actress in a rubbish film? The story is a hundred years old about a few friends on holiday & something is after them. Films like that have been tackled a zillion times in Hollywood, what was the point in turning it into a zillion & one now? The most stupid thing in the film is that every time they kill one dog then two dogs appear out of nowhere maybe there is a Killer Dog factory around the place somewhere. It is not mentioned clearly that why these dogs are killing people without a reason probably because they see whipped cream & a cherry on top above people's heads. My personal advice would be to avoid this film because it will save your money & time. While I was watching it in the cinemas a few people just left the hall half way through the film and they didn't come back! Worth a miss.\n",
      "It is truly sad to watch Michelle Rodriguez, who is a pretty good actress and damned sexy, continue to spiral downwards doing bad films. Cosigned to this bit of Direct to DVD Perdition is \"The Breed\", a clichéd horror movie where everyone involved just phoned it in. (Hey, if They can't rise above clichés in the writing, I feel no obligation to rise above them in the review.) <br /><br />\"Bark, Bark\" \"What is it, Lassie, has Michelle's career fallen down the well?\" \"Bark bark\".<br /><br />So two brothers, two hot chicks and the Expendable Black Guy(TM) go to a summer house that just happens to share an Island with the Abandoned Secret Government Research Facility. As it turns out, the island is swarming with mutant rabid genetically engineered dogs that attack people en masse and are smart enough to eliminate their means of escape or rescue.<br /><br />What follows are the typical things you've seen in every zombie movie ever, but with dogs. You know what WC Fields said about never working with children or animals, they always upstage you. Dogs leap out of nowhere. Dogs break in through boarded up windows. Dogs pop up when you've thought you've escaped.<br /><br />The thing is that you know what's going to happen a few minutes before the characters do. YOU Know the Expendable Black Guy is going to be the first one to get it, because the Expendable Black Guy is always the first one to get killed in movies like these. You know that when they think they've gotten away on a boat left on the Island, that there will be a dog hiding down below in the hold (ending the movie or leaving room for a sequel? The Breed 2: Back to the Pound. Heaven help us.)<br /><br />Then there are the leaps in logic. Michelle gets shot in the leg with an arrow, but barely seems phased by it. The other girl is bitten and seems to have a telepathic link to the dogs, but they don't go anywhere with it.<br /><br />Wondering if the dogs piddled on the script when they marked their territory, because it certainly seems like they did.\n",
      "This isn't a good movie, Starring usually good actors like Hill Harper, Taryn Manning and Michelle Rodriguez that don't seem to focused this time maybe they fought it would be like a vacation shooting the movie.<br /><br />Two people have bigger roles than them, I don't know their names nor would I want to considering how awful they are.<br /><br />The movie is NOT SCARY, while being trapped by devious dogs from hell they manage to have a good time drinking and stuff.<br /><br />Not much more to say really, I guess if you already are afraid of dogs like some people are then you might get scared but otherwise, no.<br /><br />Being a guy who's had a lot of dogs, I could tell that the dogs were in a happy mood for most of the time, which is good for the dogs BUT bad for the movie-watcher because all the tension is thrown out the window.<br /><br />And the end was incredibly bad as well, because well I won't spoil it BUT the end is not satisfying.\n",
      "Quite simply, this movie should have gone straight to DVD. All horror movies of the same Hollywood cash-in repetition should, but like many before it this had a theatrical release.<br /><br />I caught it on DVD, not in the cinema, and I wasn't impressed at all.<br /><br />For starters, to me, if you have a budget with which to make a film, why choose this concept. An island that has been completely emptied and overthrown by normal looking dogs, but which a few teens (played by adults) can survive on...It's daft, and I bet even the makers realised this when they played back their footage of close ups of cute doggies eyes.<br /><br />There are a few \"jumpy bits\", but you can make people jump with no budget what so ever, and this by no means makes up for the moody, unlikeable underdeveloped characters that I almost wanted to die. The lead role of Nicki by Michelle Rodriguez hardly pulled the film up, she seemed not to realise she was the one all quality, emotion and interest relied on and just fell in with the crowd of moody generic teenagers.<br /><br />The scenes in which the dogs physically and strategically attacked were laughable, they were basically things happening that no dog could ever do, (such as a plane being untied and drifting away) , with a few dogs sat around, cutely relaxing.<br /><br />Acting, bad (mediocre by Michelle R.), script, daft and unnecessary, music, generic unoriginal American \"oh my god oh my god!\" movie horror music.<br /><br />Don't bother unless you're forced. There's plenty of really good movies out there for you to watch, and they'll take the same amount of time and effort.<br /><br />3/10\n",
      "The video and audio quality is sub-par. To me, it felt like a home video reminiscent of something you'd see taken at the relatives place on Thanksgiving Day.<br /><br />The acting is amateurish, forced, and seemingly barely rehearsed. The screenplay/dialog is poorly written.<br /><br />You just know a movie is going to blow when 50% of the opening credits go to special FX techs, the dude who cast \"extras\" for zombies, and the writer/director/editor is credited with about a half of a dozen other billets.<br /><br />Usually, I'd say that a movie this horrible is worth watching for the simple entertainment of pointing and laughing at how bad it is... but the whole thing from start to finish is mind numbingly dull.\n",
      "Let me start by saying this: if you liked this movie, good for you but please don't think that I don't \"get it\" simply because I didn't like it. No...I get it, and it still sucks out loud.<br /><br />This film is a rarity for me. It actually made me angry that I sat through all of it. Most bad horror movies I can simply shrug off with a simple \"man, that was terrible\", but not this one. Even accompanied by a liberal amount of alcohol and a very healthy suspension of disbelief I still think this is truly just an awful movie. Why? Numerous reasons.<br /><br />First of all, giving some \"actors\" some white grease paint for their faces and black around the eyes doesn't make a zombie. I realize you do what you can on a small budget, but if your zombies look like they're straight off of a Misfits album cover, just stop there. Hell, leave their faces alone and just smear fake blood on them. Trust me, it's a better effect. And that little disclaimer at the beginning of the film with something about the movie being violent and disturbing...get rid of that. Nobody likes a liar. The only person who would find this disturbing is *maybe* an 8 year old...but kids are so screwed up today even that's a stretch.<br /><br />Then there's the script, acting, and direction. All well below par for any movie, indie or not. The actors throughout the entire film looked like someone with a shy bladder thinking \"don't watch me! I can't do it when you watch me!\". I imagine they may have been half way convincing off screen, but as soon as someone said action they just froze and delivered some of the most mundane, bland dialogue I have ever seen. The story was equally flawed...leaving much of the background information out of the film. I suppose I could knock the production values and minor technical crap like that, but it's an indie movie after all and you make do with what you can afford.<br /><br />The pluses to this movie? It's only 60 minutes long so your suffering will be limited. And...well...that's about it. If you really want to watch a bad zombie movie that's at least funny bad, go watch Death Metal Zombies. Skip this junk.\n",
      "I sat down to watch this movie, with my brother. Together, we are NOTORIOUS fans of any and all zombie movies. However, I was almost instantly let down. From the opening shot with some unknown woman writing in her journal about a mysterious man who ruined the planet or somesuch, into the overly pretentious 11 minute opening credits....... OK, I digress.. but seriously, who cares about the radio stations still working and the 2 fat guys who drive around for a while mumbling. I don't have any idea what they were blathering on about and I somehow doubt it would have improved the scene much if I'd bothered to turn the volume up to a level which would have made the background music cause my ears to bleed. Wwhile I'm on the subject of music...it was there when it shouldn't have been and STOPPED the moment it needed to be there.. music while talking and none during 'action'. I absolutely despise when somebody reviews a movie that they did not even watch through, but *I* could not finish this movie.. for only the third time ever ( the first, being the pitiful remake of Rollerball, and second being that miserable piece of rancid feces, Freddy Got Fingered).<br /><br />We got tired of all the non-stop \"dialogue\" and ended up fast forwarding in minor one-minute increments to see if it would ever end.. 30 minutes into the movie there was no sign of substance. So we took a five minute jump and were.... rewarded... with a blurry slow motion shot of people chewing on what appeared to be bloody eels, in a seriously unconvincing manner. The great John Romero did much much better with FRIED CHICKEN.. nothing bloody.. nothing weird....simple FRIED CHICKEN.<br /><br />Another leap revealed something that seemed to approach an action scene but was lacking in background music (mentioned above) and we simply shut the \"film\" off. I went back later to try again... and still couldn't. Everyone's lines were forced, their every motion was filled with stagefright... or possibly too much drug usage. Seriously, the little kid looked high. For crying out loud guys, you should have at least watched your own film and realized that you BADLY needed to do another take. Heck, even other indie filmmakers have the intellect to know when they are making an unwatchable scene.<br /><br />I'm not even going to be able to be polite here and say something re-assuring like \"good first effort'.... these guys just don't have the talent to make movies. I'm aware they also have a history of attacking reviewers.. have at it, guys.. it won't change how simply awful this is. You're not \"indie filmmakers\" you're just a bunch of kids with a camera. This \"film\" is acceptable for an 8th grade show and tell session; nothing more.\n",
      "Shrooms basically is a Slasher Movie. 3 couples go to Ireland woods to collect magic mushrooms and trip out. Of course on their way they already meet some strange inhabitants of the woods and it doesn't take long until a creepy story is being told at the campfire which of course is more than just a story. So strange things happen, people start disappearing, silhouettes move through the woods and the creepy story starts to melt into reality. The idea of blurring the lines between reality and imagination is quite nice and works after the horror kicks in along with the effect of the mushrooms. Problem is that the pacing of the movie is damn slow and doesn't really pick up much till the end. So I often looked at my watch since it seemed and eternity. Shrooms is not a bad movie, it has some nice modern elements like the typical washed out colors, some nice tripping ideas like a speaking cow mixing in with the classic campfire story and haunted woods themes. Anyway its hard to be sucked into the movie... it tries to be hypnotic with the trippy visuals and permanent uncertainty of reality and imagination. But it just rides that horse too long and too slow... so when you get the ends twist you already might be too sleepy to care. If you want to see a trippy mix of Evil Dead, Blair Witch Project and High Tension go check it out, but don't expect too much action and gore.\n",
      "I saw this movie tonight. Never have left comment here but feel compelled to warn you all before wasting your money in cinema - AVOID! I'm Irish and this film was made by Irish people, but never have I been so insulted by such deedley-i-isms, or laughed so hard at the completely rubbish and regurgitated story that they peddle here. Absolute load of tosh - stolen sequences from at least 10 different films, not the slightest bit scary or ironic. They were too cheap to spend any money on gore so decided to go for the 'unseen horror' option. The film actually got booed in the cinema as the end credits rolled, by not just me, but half the audience. Breathnach should be ashamed of himself, never show this film in Ireland again, and stay well away from the horror genre. Shame on Bord Scannan na hEireann for giving him the money, but it just goes to show what an old boys club the 'Irish Film Industry' actually is. *response to 'Johnofgod'* I do not work anywhere near the entertainment industry, and have as such no grudge to carry against anyone therein. In fact I'm a science student, and have no desire to pick up a movie camera. I am however a fan of cinema and horror movies and take offense when a 'popular' director picks a 'popular' genre and makes a total pigs ear out of it, when I then in turn am expected to shell out premium prices for someone else's vanity and back-clapping. I am quite certain also that the good money thrown after bad towards salaries, production and marketing on this one, could have funded 5 superior new hopefuls with the aim of in fact igniting a revival in the 'Industry' and saving the rest of us from the embarrassing drivel we got. I saw the film as the surprise film at the Horrorthon in the IFI, and certainly did not choose to see it as such. Given the surprise film from previous years, this one certainly was a surprise, and I'll be hard pressed to attend again next year. I don't know if you were there but certainly the boos I heard were not phantomised. I am entitled however to express my opinion of the film on this opinion page for the film, and given the other comments I do not think I am alone in my musings. Your unashamed vitriol towards my comments only serves to make me think that I have possibly hit a nerve with your own misgivings towards an 'industry' within which you are vaguely 'un/employed'.\n",
      "I cannot remember the last time a horror movie irritated me to this degree...SHROOMS is about a group of American friends (who actually don't appear to like each other much) who go to Ireland for vacation. They're obviously spoiled brats because the only thing on their mind when they're in freakin' IRELAND is getting their hands on some magic mushrooms ASAP. They meet up with some Irish friend (who is obviously British faking a bad Irish accent) that the lead girl (played by the creepy little girl from JC's VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED--the rest of her face has now caught up with her forehead, thank goodness) is creaming over. They immediately go camping in the woods and searching for shrooms. VotD girl gnaws on a mushroom that the Irish-but-British guy specifically said not to eat because it's poisonous. Soon she starts flipping out and having flash-forwards about her friends dying. It's up to her to save her friends from the ominous backwoodsmen, the creepy black-hooded ghost that pops up between people legs and/or above their heads, and the obvious overused plot twists in the script.<br /><br />It seems like every line of dialogue spoken by the obnoxious 20-somethings in this movie features the word \"shrooms.\" And you thought JUNOisms were annoying! If you took a sip of your Irish coffee every time someone in this movie said \"shrooms,\" you'd be dead before the first jump scare.<br /><br />The only good thing about SHROOMS is the movie poster, which features a skull shaped out of SHROOMS in the moonlight. Cool!\n",
      "I've seen hundreds of horror movies in my lifetime. This rates among one of the least entertaining or scary.<br /><br />None of the characters were convincing or engaging, in fact I prayed for their deaths after about 15 minutes. The plot was nigh on skull-numbingly poor and the scares relied almost totally on sound effects and offered precious little on the visual front.<br /><br />In its favour, the plot was not entirely predictable, but I was left not really caring what happened less than a third of the way through.<br /><br />The thin pretext of a 'shroom'ing holiday could have quite easily been left out and all of the visions etc. could have been explained by a dodgy smell in the air...<br /><br />Anyway, don't bother wasting your time with this one. Have a nice cup of tea instead and do something constructive...\n",
      "This was the surprise film at the Dublin Horrorthon this year and let's just say it was only surprising in that this is all that can be made of horror in Ireland. Firstly, the writer of the film must never have taken mushrooms in his or her life as during one \"sex scene\" the two unsuspecting teens take mushrooms and proceed to have sex, a noise outside is heard and they chalk it up to it being the \"shrooms\" taking effect. I understand that it was their first time taking them so that's the writing leeway that they allowed but there is a big difference in taking mushrooms where your entire physical senses are changed and thinking you heard a twig snapping. <br /><br />The only idea of mushrooms that stays with the \"plot\" after the first forty minutes is the supposed special black headed mushrooms our heroine takes that allows her to see into the future. Boll**ks, I expected the idea of how messed up it would be to have a killer chasing you wile on mushrooms to be the basis of the plot, but aghast no! They don't need an interesting plot when you can just bash together some loud noises to try and scare the audience every two minutes. <br /><br />The main character spends twenty minutes of the film walking around an insane asylum with an axe, that's not an exaggeration. Twenty bloody minutes with nothing happening. There were literally people talking amongst themselves in the audience through sheer boredom.<br /><br />The film has one redeeming feature, and that is the appearance of Don Wycherley and Sean McGinley as the two hicks. I'm Irish and personally have no problem with someone creating a stereotype of us from time to time and I think the exaggerated acting was a welcome relief. No one complained when there were extreme freak rednecks in the likes of Texas chainsaw Massacre or Wrong Turn and considering I believe there are people in this country who still believe in \"the banshee\", fairy rings and other such insane Carroll's Irish Gift Store endorsed ideas, that it is entirely appropriate to enhance this image into that of the drooling country freak. We've all met at least one, come on, don't deny it. <br /><br />To sum up, this film is in a word, bollo**s. Sorry to use the inarticulate \"foul\" language and constant air quotes but there's nothing else to go by with this one. It's the greatest waste of money. Take a hint producers, next time you want to give a new starter a chance in the business, make sure the script isn't the largest pile of cow dung to come out since, well, hell I'll just say it, The Roost. Hang on.... cow dung.... maybe that's where.......?\n",
      "Our Transatlantic puritanical fundaMentalist Judaeo-Christian cousins (at least once removed) strike again, with yet another fear-mongering propagandist defecation.<br /><br />This time, they are feebly attempting to turn our hearts and minds against the psychedelic mushroom, and all those who indulge in such practises of course, by suggesting that anyone (even an cloying, incessantly altruistic, All American teenage virgin cheerleader-stereotype) can become a psychotic sadistic murderer overnight after ingesting a single \"Death cap\" mushroom (not even a psychedelic strain: merely a poisonous lookalike).<br /><br />This moronic \"update\" of Reefer Madness, shamelessly and inappropriately steals several visual scenes from the infinitely more intelligent classic, Jacob's Ladder, which remains the only genuinely frightening film of this ilk, in my opinion.<br /><br />Ah, why am I even bothering. I had better things to do than watch this stool, never mind describe it to you, who is obviously even now contemplating wasting the best part of two hours on this drivel. OK, if you want to see trippy visuals, this is not the film for you: watch Fear and Loathing again, or google \"optical illusion\". This is nothing more than anti-drug propaganda, badly-made on a shoestring, directed and acted by people who have never even seen someone on (or apparently met anyone who has ever taken) psychedelics.\n",
      "A group of five friends travel to Ireland during their school break vacation in order to do some shrooms in the wilderness along with their Irish friend/ mushroom guide. When Tara (Lindsey Haun) takes a particularly bad mushroom, she fills her mind with horrific visions of the past and of her friends' future. A future that will bring death and destruction. It's also a future that will hold boredom, and a wasted hour and a half for those who choose to watch this uninvolving, predictable, agonizingly slow horror flick. The acting is all right, but the scares are just sadly non-existent. Also the ending (which anyone with half a brain can figure out EARLY in the movie) is pretty much a direct rip-off of another modern horror film (no spoilers) <br /><br />My Grade: D+\n",
      "When I first heard that my local movie theater was going to be playing a movie called \"Shrooms.\" I laughed simply at the name and concept of it. A drug-induced horror flick? Reading the poster tag line, the first few movies I thought about were \"The Tripper\" and \"Idle Hands,\" both had a comedic edge to it.<br /><br />I decided that I would give it a go. After work was finished, I slipped in to watch it as we gave the print a run through.<br /><br />It appeared to me at first to be a fairly basic horror flick. You have the classic group of teens setting out into the woods alone, you have the suspicious characters who seem to lurk on the outside of this group, and you have the stranded complex which ties their permanency to the unfamiliar setting. Trite, but hey, a lot of classics seem to fare well with these aspects.<br /><br />First, off there are some pros to the film, though they are only very slight. The side characters and presences were fairly convincing in making me believe that there was some malevolent murderer outside of the teenage group. Even when I had considered my verdict, these factors were almost enough to make me think otherwise. (Note, almost).<br /><br />The cons of this film are as follows: As I watched the characters get picked off one by one. I was positively sure as to who was committing the murders by the second to third dead victim. (To my misfortune, I was correct.) I was able to come to this conclusion because of the repetitive mechanics that befell every incident relentlessly. First, the main character would have a vision of who would die. Within the next five minutes or so, that person would die. Soon after, perhaps another five minutes or so, the main character would find her friend dead. To what I can recall, this pattern occurred with every single character. The main character's visions were never inaccurate to what would happen, nor were they ever vague, so when the given character would die, you had already seen it happen. When the hallucinations would occur later in the film, you could begin to suspect what was going to happen, and chances are that you're left with no sense of shock. Overall, It was a very boring prospect.\n",
      "A group of average American college students head to the Emerald Isle strictly for the 'shrooms. Funny, never saw that in any Ireland brochure, must be a well kept secret, but I guess if it's in a direct-to-video movie it must be true. This is a good looking film, the production value is good considering it's obvious a low budget project. Lots of convincing dirt and grime as most of the action takes place in a damp Irish forest. The atmosphere is effectively ominous. I found some of the scenes, although admittedly supposed to be taking place at night, too dark to really see what's going on, which was frustrating at times. The violence, disappointingly takes place mostly off screen, but you get an adequate look at some damaged body parts and corpses which is nicely done. The lead actress, who reminds me of a certain cast member from Scrubs, seizes, \"trips\" and hyperventilates her way into our hearts. Generally the acting is mostly just adequate, but I thought she was the best of the lot. I found the ending to be mostly uninspired and unoriginal. Could really see it coming. But, despite all this, hey, I've seen worse. MUCH worse. The director shows definite talent and I will keep an eye peeled for any of his future projects. All and all a 4/10\n",
      "Thin plot - even for a teen slasher movie.<br /><br />Where's my free sample of shrooms or any mind inducing drug? I could have used this while watching Shrooms.<br /><br />The blueish hue is supposed to make this much more scarier...it just don't work. It just makes it look bad - real bad.<br /><br />There could have been some humor thrown in to make this a good film...especially since the shrooms were supposed to make you laugh...but no. Just lame action, uninteresting dialog, boring sett.<br /><br />Add to that, the typical screech that all horror movies must have and it just becomes really boring and bland.<br /><br />So much could have been done with this, but so much was left out. I assume that a second or third write was never thought of before filming and that nobody thought to expand on the story a bit.<br /><br />I want my sample damnit!!!! I deserve some good quality drugs after sitting through this.<br /><br />At least everybody got a paycheck out of it - or should have.<br /><br />Kinda shitty ending.\n",
      "I saw the advert for \"shrooms\" and instantly wanted to see it so i rented a copy. I think the real clincher that will get this film an audience is the fact that it brings the drug element into a horror. I was hoping for a very trippy film that was so messed up you don't know whether to scream or rewind and rethink.<br /><br />Unfortunately \"Shrooms\" goes for the premonition approach. After taking a bad shroom, Tera the main girl starts \"seeing things\". I just thought from that point on i'd seen it all before. I was right. Most of this film is simply people walking around, looking for something with a scared look on their face. The whole back story seems to be a relatively regurgatated camp fire tale that is used in most films \"a bad house, kids are abused, one messed up kid left\"- come on this just isn't scary.<br /><br />Admittedly the ending is clever, but again not the most original.<br /><br />The potential this film had is wasted on what seems to be a boring storyline. Not much trippyness or edge of your seat tension, just another B-grade horror.\n",
      "This film was perhaps one of the most boring horror films I've ever sat through, the plot was boring, the characters were boring, even the deaths were boring! With a name like Shrooms you imagine this will be a horror film with some sort of 'Trainspotting' appeal in places but this film lacked any sort of interesting concept whatsoever! The film is based around a group of American teens visiting Ireland with one purpose to take magic mushrooms & have a good time. They are meet at the airport by main character Tara's (Lindsey Haun) on/off boyfriend type Jake (Jack Huston), he appears to be local although he too has an American accent. The group head off to the woods & get high & soon enough they're being killed one by one.<br /><br />If anything this film did two things make me laugh at the poor acting, particularly Haun's wooden acting & it also made me slightly angry at the representation of Ireland. Why make a film set in Ireland & then cast all main characters as American I'll never understand but it explains why the film was so obsessed with promoting Ireland as some sort of drug paradise.<br /><br />I actually had to force myself to finish watching the film as I hate to not finish a film & my attention was wandering constantly. The villains were like something off Lord of the rings & the ending seemed like the writer was getting bored & thought just end it quick I'm fed up. The twist should have been suggested a little earlier in order to hold the audience's attention because honestly I think that was the only slightly interesting thing out of the entire film. My advice give this one a miss, you'll be bored within minutes & feel cheated by the boring ending & the poor acting displayed. Plus if you are from or have ever been to Ireland the representation of 'the locals' will only insult you somewhat.\n",
      "I've only myself to blame.<br /><br />When a film boasts that it has a group of tourists getting high on funny mushrooms, resulting in them being \"attacked by ghostly creatures, never sure whether they are experiencing gruesome reality or startling hallucinations\", the chances are it will contain tourists getting high on funny mushrooms, resulting in them being attacked by ghostly creatures, never sure whether they are experiencing gruesome reality or startling hallucinations.<br /><br />And I am unlikely to really go for that.<br /><br />So what we have is some young people, who start out alright, but become more repugnant as the film goes, running around a swamp, screaming, swearing, getting more and more muddy, while bodies and leering faces jump out at them in entirely predictable ways, while the camera zooms around in that style that has become quite trendy in recent years. Admittedly, a story that involves hallucinations is as good as any to be filmed in such a way, but that doesn't make it any less annoying.<br /><br />The result is an incomprehensible mishmash; ugly (not so much because of gore, as there is surprisingly little, but the direction), dumb and, in the end, just dull. But I will give it one thing.<br /><br />It's the first time I've ever seen a horror film with a talking cow.\n",
      "A group of young American tourists visit Ireland to experience magic mushrooms. Their Irish guide, Jake (I don't claim to be an expert on the Irish accent but",
      "was that an Irish accent?!) takes them deep into the woods to hunt for the psychedelic fungi and enjoy them as nature intended. Before they even make it to the camping spot their vehicle hits an animal and they run into two creepy redneck types. When they reach the intended spot, one of the first things their buddy Jake does is take away their cell phones. After regaling his group with some creepy local legend stories over some tasty mushroom tea they are off to do some hunting. Although warned to not consume the Death Head mushroom one of the female characters does exactly that. Each character has their own unique \"trip\". Some of these episodes are actually pretty entertaining. Meanwhile our death head shroom girl is freaking right out and having vividly horrific visions of her friend's deaths. Then we get into this whole dodgy is it real or isn't real scenario. In the end, which many will see before it comes, is a very lame and empty conclusion. The group spends a lot of time bickering, and don't seem as though they should eat dinner together never mind traveling half way across the freaking world to do mushrooms. The characters are disposable and you really don't care who dies next. The deaths are pretty unimaginative particularly considering the whole stoned aspect. They really could have gotten more creative here. And as I mentioned the ending is just so weak. The landscape is lovely, the production value is decent and there is some gore. It had some potential but it failed to deliver.\n",
      "This is getting ridiculous now. Would a bunch of American tourists travel all the way over to Ireland to sample some magic mushrooms and camp out in a scary wood? I mean REALLY? Haven't these kids got anything better to do with their time? And would they leave their mobiles in the car in the middle of nowhere? And when they come across a couple of weirdos armed with guns out hunting, why aren't they just a bit perturbed that their group is alone in the forest with them overnight? I know I shouldn't be asking these questions, I should be getting into the spirit of the movie and setting myself up for a scare etc. Sorry, but after sitting through this sort of crap 100s of times my patience has finally snapped. Let's see what else we have here..<br /><br />Oh of course the ghostly killer. It all starts with a story around a campfire, as the only Oirish member of the Yank party tells a tale of a old boys school in the area, a massacre and spirits left behind. Blah blah blah. No one believes this happened.. until people start turning up dead. Before they discover the first of the victims, we have an extended scene of a blonde rushing around shouting BLUTO BLUTO that could have been cut by a couple of millenia. Oh, did I mention this little nymphet has premonitions about the murders thanks to her digestion of an extra strong black spotted fungi? I didn't? Oh darn.<br /><br />There now follows, in no particular order: dull killings, bad acting, a talking cow, a hairy wolfman, cleavage shots of sexy young things being chased.. you know the formula. When done right, this can see to a satisfying horror experience. When done wrong, you get.. well, Shrooms. 2/10\n",
      "Just watched this tonight, the lass is at work, the kid is in bed... was bored so stuck it on, and why not eh? wasn't expecting a massive amount from this movie tbh - in fact i only got it coz i have been reverting back to my childhood days lately and have fancied a bit of horror again (i grew up on horror) and the added mushroom factor only poured fuel on the the fire - horror/scary things in general is last thing u want when ur high on that shat... anyway, turned off lights and got settled, trying to give it a chance..<br /><br />Opening scenes were good i thought, trying to get in early shocks and jumps with the running over of the cow (or what ever that was, a deer?), the 1st sights of the location was promising, big scary woods, nice open fields, a stream etc... Party time? And then it started to go wrong and the horror clichés were unleashed.. The creepy stories around the camp fire - which although are the starting point for the horror, like in 99% of horror movies, it all starts with the telling of a story.. but it is getting tiresome and the story itself lacks any horror merit i think.. It is an obvious laziness of the writers. No imagination! The idea of this movie could of been great, a real future cult classic if it was done correctly.. but it wasn't done right! The horror was weak, the script was weak, the characters were to 'teen movie' what ever happened to good adult horror? all the horror i see now seems to be aimed at teens - and its boring! To sum it up, the only saving grace to this movie was the half decent acting, some of the camera work was well done - nice moving shots through the woods.. And although most of the reviewers here say the twist was obvious and they got it in the 1st 20-30 mins.... Well, i got it - but only figured it out maybe 10-15 mins b4 they dropped it - maybe just a slow night for me.<br /><br />Im afraid Horror as a genre is dead - it is all just commercialized like with everything else now - they get a good idea and cut/trim/change it to fit a mass audience and i don't like that.. They should be aiming to please the few that care, not the masses that don't really have an opinion either way.<br /><br />Anyway, forget this movie - it was a boring waste of time after 15 mins or so and never gets any better! a talking cow? f off! Go stick in a classic if u wanna watch some good horror - the shining or the omen. watch how the professionals do it haha.\n",
      "Due to the recent Full Moon Feature \"Killer Bong\", I was incredibly apprehensive to see this latest drug-themed horror yarn. Thankfully, \"Shrooms\" isn't a dopey comedy, written to appeal to the minds of adolescent boys... Unfortunately, it is a painfully boring movie, despite that, seemingly, winning endorsement. A group of teenage friends venture into rural Ireland during mushroom season with plans no more extensive than \"tripping out\". One of the girls unknowingly eats one of the 'wrong' kind of mushrooms and experiences uncontrollable premonitions of her friends' deaths. Honestly, who funded an Ireland vacation for a group of stereotypical losers, who head right from the airport to the bleak woods, with no food other than the fungi they intended on?? The whole basic premise seemed utterly forced into a tired formula of young, drug taking campers. This, inevitably, leads to the incorporation of a spooky ghost story (which ends up supplying a source for the hooded killer), which was pointless in the long run, but I guess the crew had access to a big, creepy building they wanted to show... Also, the involvement of the two inbreeders seemed like gratuitous filler. Numerous scenes in this dragged on effortlessly while the end was a complete ripoff of \"Identity\" and \"High Tension\". To sum it all up - I pretty much hated this movie!\n",
      "A group of American teens take a trip to trip (on 'shrooms, that is). Told by a mutual friend about the ultimate drug trip by a certain type of magic mushroom, they head to the woods to experience it for themselves. However, after a bad batch, the group begins to see unearthly visions of demonic apparitions trying to attack them. Reality is blurred as the group of friends try to figure out if the visions are simple hallucination. . . or a true, evil threat.<br /><br />First of all, may I ask: Where the hell did they get this Irish guy? Because. . . he's not Irish and whatever casting director thought his British accent would go over as Irish is absolutely ridiculous. Just had to get that out. Now, onto the film: I think I've decided on a new title: Clichrooms. It's a nice blend on the two main components of this film: shrooms and clichés. Within the first ten minutes we're given: the typical idiot stoner, the nice girl in love with the 'bad boy with a heart of gold' foreigner, the travel deep in the woods for less-than-moral activity, being stranded due to hitting an animal, the shady forests 'looking for dinner,' etc. (I won't even mention the dozen we get at the end of the film.) It got annoying, but eventually evened out when the plot developed. The acting isn't awful, but not very good. . . just enough to make the film watchable. The backstory of the home for delinquents (or whatever the wannabe-Irish guy was talking about) was interesting, and I'm glad it was utilized a bit. The writing was quite off, however, resulting in stiff and boring dialogue and poor structure (and, eventually, a bit of a cheap ending). Breathnach's direction and Nanu Segal's cinematography weren't bad and worked well for the film, although the 'trip' visuals got a little too 'MTV' in their editing. Gore is almost nonexistent, or cut away too quickly. Dario Marianelli, an amazing composer, is one positive on this film. The music is very good, and it surprised me when I first heard it, and surprised me even more when I saw the composer. The blur of reality and fiction is actually effective, as it did make the film more than just a typical 'in the woods' slasher. But it wasn't enough to make it as thrilling as it could've been. It's entertaining enough, just chock-full of clichés which limit the worth of watching it.<br /><br />Final verdict: 4/10. Meh.\n",
      "I had seen the poster for this film, but I didn't really think about critics opinions or anything before I watched it, maybe I should of. Basically some American teenagers arrive in the Ireland, and are promised by Irish friend Jake (Jack Huston), and expert in mushrooms, the \"trip\" of a lifetime, knowing their eagerness for adventure. Jake warns about the certain \"shrooms\" they can't eat, but hardly any of them listen, and horrific visions start happening. Because they are high on these magic mushrooms, they don't know if the ghostly creatures and other things are for real, or part of their hallucinations, to be honest, neither do we (the audience). There are also some really creepy woodsmen, Ernie (Don Wycherley) and Bernie (Sean McGinley) don't help the panicking teens. As everyone is being bumped off, it becomes clear that it doesn't matter if these visions are real or not, the evidence is there afterwards, the ending however, with last survivor, Tara (Lindsey Haun), isn't great. Also starring Max Kasch as Troy, Maya Hazen as Lisa, Alice Greczyn as Holly and Robert Hoffman as Bluto. The plot is certainly innovative, and the gore amount gives the story a bit of energy, but just like the characters, you don't know what's real and what's not, and it is a little tedious. Okay!\n",
      "It seems that all I see are horror movies lately and well . . . I saw a trailer for Shrooms months ago and had decided there and then that I would see it and it would be awesome! Oh how I was wrong! With such a wonderful premise I just can't explain what happened?! Well I can try. The cast did what they could making some slightly interesting, if annoyingly cliché-ridden, characters! However, there were a few very attractive actresses that helped to draw that attention away . . . for a brief second.<br /><br />To be honest I could go on and pick at this film and break the maximum word limit on this because I was so disappointed in the overall quality of horror films and how Shrooms had the potential to break the trend of bog standard cliché ridden horror flicks but no! <br /><br />What's good? One star for each good thing. 1) The cast do the best giving some good performances 2) The talking cow, that's all I'm going to say 3) This is only worth watching if you want a pointless jump fest! <br /><br />What's bad? Follows the typical killing off one person at a time (boring!). After the first few initial jumpy moments, it's really slow and then to top it all off it has the worst ending ever. You just feel cheated as if they ran out of time and thought this will do! This film encourages drugs in a way for all the wrong reasons. In which I would rather get high on mushrooms or whatever, then endure this again! If you want a superior horror film watch 30 Days of Night!\n",
      "Ireland may have given the world hurling, green beer, Graham Norton, and that funny dancing where the arms don't move, but it isn't exactly renowned for its horror movies. Shrooms, a psychological chiller from director Paddy Breathnach, is unlikely to change that fact.<br /><br />A dreadful chiller set in the wilds of the 'Emerald Isle', Shrooms sees a group of teens run into a spot of bother when they experiment with hallucinogenic fungi: as they begin to trip out, they begin to check out. Is there any truth in the stories about murderous spirits that haunt the woods? Or is someone else responsible for their deaths?<br /><br />With nasty desaturated colours, irritating performances from most of the cast (who over-act in a desperate attempt to show the world what they are capable of), frequently fuzzy visuals (used to try and simulate being whacked out of your gourd on drugs), blatant cribs from other horror films (The Blair Witch project and many an Asian ghost film), and virtually no gore or gratuitous nudity, could this mess be any more annoying?<br /><br />Of course it could.<br /><br />Rather than tell a straightforward scary story, Breathnach unwisely chooses to blur the line between what is reality and what is merely a figment of a drug-addled mind. In doing so, he confuses matters so much that the film ceases to be frightening. And let's not forgot about the talking cow, the daft plot device to rid the characters of their cell phones, the Jason Mewes/Jay lookalike, the inbred goat herders, and the extremely bad twist ending!!\n",
      "could have been great. interesting enough idea. amazing antagonist. some really great camera work/mood.<br /><br />however...it feels like a lock groove. similar scenes playing out time and time again similar camera tricks again and again it tried to be smart just as high tension did (both failed miserably) and is basically a slasher flick again could have been amazing, however...ended up being slow and a bit boring however the moments that deliver really deliver.<br /><br />unfortunately it just doesn't make it at the end of the day.... but it tried...and i want to see more of the 'killer' shame... proceed with caution, but know what you're getting into. it's soaked in mood so...that can be enjoyed at least.\n",
      "Tony Montana didn't build his empire after a weekend's charabanging in Aberystwyth. Unlike other drugs, the magic mushroom is largely unrepresented in movies and it'snot to see why. If cocaine is Al Pacino, magic mushrooms would probably be Rhys Ifans. Mushroom munching doesn't generally lead to your boss's wife overdosing spectacularly, FBI helicopters chasing you down the freeway, or free-diving around Edinburgh's sewage system to an Brian Eno / Daniel Lanois soundtrack; altogether, it's a conspicuously un-cinematic high. Compared with a crimson flower-burst sprouting in a syringe, a cable of coke on a gleaming mirror, or even the mighty Camberwell Carrot, how cool is a cup of tea? <br /><br />Just a handful of films have nibbled round the caps, including Performance, Work Is A Four Letter Word and - coyly - Dougal And The Blue Cat (less a whimsical child-friendly distraction, than an escalating series of terrifying derangements), in which Dylan the rabbit complains of feelings of exhaustion after cultivating his \"crazy mushrooms\".<br /><br />And now Shrooms, the latest addition to this sub-sub genre, in which some American backpackers discover the downside to pigging out on fungi fancies. Tara (Haun) doesn't even take Aspirin - so perhaps isn't ideally suited to fly to the Old Country on a drugs hunt at the invitation of an Irish school friend-turned-mushroom guru called Jake. But \"nobody's ever died from taking 'shrooms before,\" she's reassured, thus guaranteeing they'll be squealing like stuck piglets before the 90 minutes is up. Ireland is a land where schoolgirls riverdance in circles - and that's before our tourists are barely through passport control. It wouldn't surprise you to see a pony in a lift, or a Guinness-swilling pig in a green velvet jerkin carrying two leprechauns under each trotter. Yet once they've left the airport and set up camp in the wild, wild wood, they could be almost anywhere. <br /><br />Jake (Huston, John's grandson, so possibly cast for his distant Celtic roots) turns out to be a supremely punchable Trustafarian tit. \"When I was first sent to boarding school I used to get the s*** kicked out of me a lot,\" he explains, and it's no surprise at all. But the discovery of those happy little mushrooms helped him through those lonely days and nights. \"These bad boys with the black nipples are the Death Heads,\" the cut-price Castaneda points out, while the audience wonders just what the heck kind of accent that is. It's not Irish. More like Joe Strummer circa 1977. \"According to the ancient Irish druids,\" he drawls, \"these are a gateway to another dimension,\" enabling one to commune with the dead, shape-shift, and predict the future. It's true, you can. Five minutes in, you're certain this feeble, derivative blarney (Blair Witch, Cabin Fever and Silent Hill can all be found bobbing away in the broth) will leave you with feelings of profound emptiness.<br /><br />Round the campfire, Jake relates a supposedly real-life ghost story concerning a nearby abandoned borstal that was run by an evil religious order called 'The Black Knights'. After stringing the kids from the rafters and flinging them to slavering hounds, one vengeful tyke spiked their soup bowls with Death Heads one night and carnage ensued. Only a monk and a feral child survived - then went missing. Legend has it, they're still roaming the woods. Nice one, Jake: just the thing to tell a bunch of silly kids with a head full of psychedelics. From here on in, it's business as usual. Bluto the jock gets slaughtered while out 'dogging', shortly after conversing with a talking cow; the rest follow suit. <br /><br />Meanwhile, Tara's witnessing their grisly deaths before they happen - or is she? As she wails, \"I overdosed on the heroin of shrooms, I don't know what's real and what's not!\" If it's not some malevolent Black Knight or feral dog boy they glimpse tearing through the trees - or do they? - it's a couple of bestial goat-herders wielding axes. Or are they? Look: here's a boy with a sack on his head. Or is there? Somebody just threw a stone in my eye. Or did they? There's no escape from your own mind. Luckily there's an escape from the cinema, just below the psychedelic Exit signs.<br /><br />Yet the real problem at the core of Shrooms is a more fundamental one: there are few ventures more redundant than trying to replicate the inner-world on film (see Shane Meadows' Dead Man's Shoes or Jan Kounen's Peyote-drenched western Blueberry for two of the more convincing efforts). 'Sacred Weeds', a 1998 TV series, encountered similar headaches after getting a bunch of dosed-up students to record their experiences live to digicam. Not being Mexican shaman with direct dialling codes to Mescalito or the Virgin Mary, these guinea-pigs' trips largely depended on the limits of their experience; they were hardly going to return from their controlled brush with salvia divinorum - containing the most powerful hallucinogen known to man - with anything but giggling fits, some musings on oak bark, and what it's like to sit in a tree. (You feel like a big old monkey, apparently.) <br /><br />\"The hallucinations are so intense, I might not be able to speak at all,\" swooned one excitable and, in the event, overly optimistic participant. But with nothing of note to report, and Sacred Weeds' under-cranked and over-cranked cameras affording scant compensation, why bother in the first place? <br /><br />Shrooms also has to make do with the self-same camera tricks to replicate the audio-visual apparitions, and to similarly lackluster effect, while its monotonous over-reliance on sudden, deafening chords pastes over the lack of genuine shocks. That said, one short scene in which Bluto first trips through the woods (in both senses) comes close to capturing the spatial dislocation common to the psychedelic experience, and one wishes the film offered more moments like this one. But as Alan Partridge once opined, \"Dere's more to Oireland dan dis.\"\n",
      "I try not to be too negative when I comment on films so I shall start with the good points.<br /><br />This film did some things well, particularly the jump shocks and setting up the atmosphere with the Black Brothers and the Lonely Twin, but the dialogue was pretty rank and unbelievable (no teenager in the history of the world has ever talked like that) and the ending twist was pulled out of a hat, in an illogical way, that the film had at no point built up to.<br /><br />The acting was variable, with the background characters done well, which was to be expected, given who was playing them, and the teenage characters varying from well done (Jake) to not so good (Lisa).<br /><br />The directing was, again, variable, as I said previously, the jump shocks were very well done, but the director seemed a little too fond of the shaky cam effect at other points. While I understand the reasoning to this, with the exception of the drowning scene, I don't think it added much to the film.\n",
      "This is one of the worst films I have ever seen and I have seen some rubbish in my time. The premise is 5 teenagers go to Ireland to try some magic mushrooms, they pickup the other token spooky Irish guy when they get there. Why bother going all the way across the globe to get high ? Anyway from the off one of the girls eats a mushroom that you shouldn't touch, so this is a big Plot signpost as to where we are going and whats going to happen. The teens get picked off one by one after the Token Irish chap tells them all a scary Moonlight story. Throw in the mix a couple of locals to try and throw you off the bait (i didn't work) and the standard make you jump moments, girl looks through crack in door somethings going to happen!! I'm just glad I watched this on sky and didn't waste any money down the Cinema.<br /><br />Avoid\n",
      "As far as serial- killer films and thrillers are concerned this one's right down there with the worst of 'em. Only \"Copycat\" and \"Sisters\" manage to be more annoying in their absurdity, and only \"Saw\" is worse. And it's a pity because the first hour is genuinely eerie, with a fittingly claustrophobic mortuary as the ideal setting. I am a very jaded viewer, but some of those early mortuary scenes really get under your skin. However, after an hour it all goes downhill, and I mean steeply. The relentlessly stupid plot twists rob you of all patience and the movie just keeps sinking to new lows. All logic is thrown into the wind, and the viewer's intelligence is insulted and pounded upon repeatedly with more force than that baseball bat could ever have generated - the one used by Nolte and McGregor. (I'd be the first to sign up if they were looking for volunteers to take that baseball bat and bash the heads of the writers of this nonsense.) Nothing here adds up. Absolutely nothing. Nolte was molesting corpses decades earlier and the writers of this film would have us believe that this man could years later become the city's chief police investigator! Making him the killer is as absurd as giving Thomas Edison credit for inventing the wheel, as laughable as a conspiracy-theory plot from the \"X-Files\", and as stupid as Kim Basinger's book on how to solve all of world's problems (if she'd ever write one). The very notion that a man - so disturbed that he indulges in necrophilia in mortuaries - would have the sanity, interest, patience, and willingness to climb all the way to chief investigator in a police department only to start a savage murder spree is simply a mind-bogglingly dumb, far-fetched concept to me.<br /><br />And how the hell did he even start with the framing of McGregor? This is an essential piece of the puzzle that is badly missing here; McGregor JUST HAPPENS to get a job where he meets Nolte. And McGregor's best friend, Brolin, JUST HAPPENS to know a prostitute who is Nolte's play toy (and later victim). It can sure be a small, small world in a Hollywood stinker! And to add some silliness, Brolin is some kind of a deranged thrill-seeker who acts like a total lunatic all the time. Obviously, he is the decoy for the viewer; we are meant to treat him as the suspect. But how dumb do they think we are? And how the hell did Brolin get into the mortuary when he carried out his \"practical joke\"? And how the hell did Nolte manage to drag out a body of one of his victims within seconds of McGregor entering the room, without McGregor noticing it (the fact that he had his walkman on and/or was singing and/or talking doesn't make it any more believable)? And what's with this annoying scene where Arquette JUST HAPPENS to walk into the mortuary at exactly the moment when McGregor is hitting Nolte with a baseball bat and predictably starts thinking her boyfriend is the killer??! More annoyances came from the scene in which Brolin's reaction to McGregor's telling him that the latter is been suspected of murder is to laugh! Or the one in which he cuts off his own thumb in order to free himself and save the others. Sure,... why not?? (\"I am being hand-cuffed to this metal pole, and as a result can neither save my friends nor myself... What do I do...? I know!... I'll cut my thumb off! How come I didn't think of that before!?...\") Nolte makes the best out of his role, but due to the bitchingly silly script he appears to be hamming it up too much at the end - but what choice did he have? McGregor is solid, too, apart from his on-and-off accent (which was it now? American or English?).\n",
      "I love movies, and I am very forgiving of most of them. (I usually like thriller/suspense movies.) But Nightwatch I gave a 1. I never give movies a 1. It's especially odd in this case as I usually LOVE Ewan McGregor. But even he (and all of it's other big-name stars) could not save this poorly written, badly executed, gross, retarded-plot movie.<br /><br />A law student has a whacked out, bored best friend, a really nice but under-defined girlfriend, some sort of poorly outlined, difficult childhood past and then gets a job as a nightwatchman in a morgue to pay for school. (This involves checking to make sure that the bodies are okay each night.) The plot just gets worse from there. I won't go into details, but realize that it's set in a morgue (just go with that image for a second), involves really icky mental disorders, hookers, bored twenty-somethings and a serial killer.<br /><br />Perhaps Nick Nolte's worst role EVER. Ewan McGregor just looks embarrassed, as do Josh Brolin and Patricia Arquette. Filled with gratuitous nastiness and gross-out violence, this movie, rather than being redeemed by such a good cast, serves only to add a black mark to their career resumes.<br /><br />As I said, I love movies and rarely, rarely, rarely diss them this hard, but I honestly believe that this is the worst movie I have ever seen.\n",
      "I haven't seen such a bad movie in a long time, actually i haven't seen such a bad movie ever. What have Miramax done with the original manuscript. This movie was one of the best ever, in the Danish version. But someone bought the rights to this movie, and tried to make a Hollywood version. But dear \"Hollywood\", you can't make a box-office hit if you first of all take the Danish humor away, and then take out some scenes from the movie, just because (my own opinion)you think it doesn't suits the American people. But 10 stars to the original version, and 1 (They didn't have 0 stars)star to the Hollywood version.\n",
      "I must say I don't like this version, just as the original version also seems a bit lame to me. The original was a big hit here in DK, and so I expected something exraordinary, but it wasn't. This is the Hollywood'ized version, but that doesn't make it any better - on some points it is even worse than the danish version. Not impressed, no, not at all... :-/\n",
      "Ah, another one of those thrillers where you're supposed to wonder about the killer's identity, suspecting everyone in turns. Well, I guessed the killer *in the video rental*, after I looked at the cover! And I was right, of course. Now that's a \"quality\" script! As for the rest - boy, where to start... The acting is either hammy (McGregor) or wooden (Arquette) and the worst thing is that this flick is so *dull* and *boring* that it makes eating tomato soup and potato chips The Great Adventure! This is a remake of the Danish original which I might choose to see one day (for free - if it's anything like this remake, it's not worth paying a penny). I doubt it can be any better, though, with the same director and writer. One star, and even that is being too generous!\n",
      "It is a fine first effort, or a mediocre second effort, or horrific life's work. The plot was a little thin. The action was a little choppy. The effects were not half bad. The video was slightly grainy. Better than a student film. But It was fun. This is not the type of film one finds at Sundance. This is the type of film one finds at a SciFi convention. If you want 90 min. of light hearted distraction, this is it.<br /><br />If one goes by the writing style, this film is the first in a series.<br /><br />I look forward to the second film in the series.<br /><br />Perhaps the lighting and cine will be better polished.\n",
      "I can't even begin to tell you what this movie was about because the photography was so bad. A good 65% of it is so dark that you can't discern anything going on. Watching this crap, many questions spring to mind. Was the DP trying to emulate the work of Nestor Almendros on DAYS OF HEAVEN by shooting only ambient lighting? How could the director, after watching several days of pitch black dailies, not decide that it might be time to invest in one lighting kit? How did the editor so seamless cut scene after scene of pitch black on pitch black so effortlessly? What photography does come through is muddy and ugly as hell. Had the cinematographer ever SEEN a movie before? I doubt it. Otherwise, concepts like \"composition\" and \"backlight\" might have played a part in the framing. When you look up cinematic incompetence in the dictionary, you'll find this second only to BACKWOODS. At least in THAT movie you could see what was going on.<br /><br />Worst movie I've seen in years. And yes, I've seen Turkish STAR WARS.\n",

      "This independent low budget drama gets good ratings for the characterization and plot. Even though it is a typical boxing movie cliché, there are enough twists to make it seem somewhat fresh and original.<br /><br />The story follows the adventurers of Dublin, a crooked boxing promoter who travels from town to town setting up underground fights and sometimes trying to fix them. He meets a female fighter, Katharine, who appears to be homeless but who can fight and defeat men twice her size. The two eventually team up, but Dublin's somewhat sleazy past catches up with them, causing conflict, pain, and emotional distress for both.<br /><br />I enjoy all types of fighting (the real kind) and consequently, I find myself being somewhat critical of film fight scenes, particularly when they involve obvious mismatches. The notion of a 135 lb woman fighting bare-knuckle with much larger, ostensibly experienced fighters and winning by KO consistently is just too much for me to willingly suspend my disbelief. The fight scenes are poorly shot, primarily because there are no stunt people and the principal actors do their own \"fighting.\" The fight theme and fight scenes are central to the film and they are just not well done. I realize that corners have to be cut somewhere in a limited budget film, but this was not the right place to do so.<br /><br />The ending was just too sappy for me and I was disappointed that the writer couldn't avoid the Hollywood style happiness and give us a real surprise for a change.<br /><br />If you enjoy the \"Underdog overcomes all obstacles\" type movie, then you may like this film, but I have to say I wasn't all that impressed.\n",

Even more, giving it is an open talent contest, half of them are singers what gives Cowell a chance for a shot closer to the \"Idol\" success.<br /><br />Regis Philbin does his job, he always manages to look as a nice guy, I don't think he contributes rising the show interest but is not responsible for the poor overcome either.<br /><br />Moving on. I may concede that the Idol's judge model settled what seems to be the Holly Grail of reality-show contests, but that's not magic. The chosen court must have some charisma. In the Idol, it was this Cowell's quality that brought attention to the show. But did he manage to put together an attractive set of judges prescinding of himself? Let's see.<br /><br />Let me start by David Hasselhoff just because he is the only I know. At least when watching Hasselhoff a couple of generations will feel some kind of comfort reminding \"Knight rider\" and \"Baywatch\". And it guarantees the show will be sold in Germany too.<br /><br />Piers Morgan, who I don't have any clue who he is, takes the role of the wise and balanced judge completing his stereotype with a British accent that in America seems -wrongfully- to be synonymous of a higher intellect.<br /><br />Finally Brandy. No, they are not drinking any alcoholic liquor, but may be you'll need it to digest why this completely unknown -or at least very well forgotten- singer (that is how they introduced her) is the judge that completes the trilogy. When Hasselhoff and Morgan are somehow appealing, Brandy is some kind of hyper-kinetic and overexcited Tasmanian Devil sat in the middle. At some point I felt bad for Morgan whose face seems Brandy preferred target for the uncontrollable spin of her arms and her annoying affection demonstrations.<br /><br />In his modesty Cowell doesn't realize that the success of his shows is linked to him being in front the cameras rather than behind them. If Simon were in this show not even the contestants would be necessary to nail its success. But this is not the case. Clearly.\n",
      "I was really looking forward to this show. There have been several people in my community that made the show. But after sitting down and watching it, I don't know if I can actually sit through another episode in order to see them. This show was more like the Gong Show from the 70's. Except you have to have 3 gongs instead of one. I was really hoping that people could get a big break with this show. There was too much of really bad talent or useless talent to have to sit through to get to the very sporadic good talent that was shown. This is not a show that I will sit through again. There are too many other quality shows that are worth my time. I'm not a big reader, but about 3/4 way through the show, I decided to start reading a book. I feel sorry for the people who got chosen to be on this show that have great talent, I hope they are not disappointed.\n",
      "I love the idea of a talent show that focuses on more than just singing, especially the same old adult contemporary music that we hear over and over and over again on the likes of American Idol, Star Search, or any other popular talent competition. The problem is that when it comes down to it it ends up being nothing more than a singing competition with some other performers thrown in for good measure, but without a shot at winning.<br /><br />The \"judges\" constantly berate people for not being diverse or \"mixing it up\" enough, which flies in the face of what the show is supposed to be about. Take, for instance, the martial arts exhibition group Sideswipe. They were told by all of the judges that they wanted to see more than just punching and kicking, and that they had to do more dancing and add more production to their numbers if they were going to have a shot at winning. WHAT!?!?!? They are a martial arts group. . . . . PUNCHING AND KICKING IS WHAT THEY DO!!! Why not tell the singers that they need to add more flips and jumps and tumbling to their acts? When it comes down to it the judges, and America, do not consider anything other than singing to be real talent, and that is a shame, because the variety is what could be the shows strongest feature.<br /><br />In defense of the show, there is much more variety than you will see on American Idol. At the end of the second season there is a blues/reggae singer, a young American Idolish singer (though not of the same caliber), a ventriloquist/impressionist whose act is 99% singing, and a beat boxing singer. There is more variety than many other talent competitions, but it would be really nice to see more of the true variety acts and far fewer singing acts.<br /><br />Another negative is that the show would be totally unwatchable without TIVO. Less than half of every show actually involves performing, and they spend way too much time on background info and letting you know what is coming up \"after the break.\"\n",
      "America's Got Talent is NBC's new baby for summer '06.. Created by Simon Cowell of American Idol fame, AGT is a talent search show which is similar in format to American Idol and the Gong Show.<br /><br />I don't normally ever watch network TV, and i'm not really big on reality shows at all, but i have been watching this because i thought it would be somewhat interesting.. turns out to be a poorly executed show that'll probably never recover from it's first season without some major changes (although it has already been renewed for a second season in '07).<br /><br />Basically it's a talent show where people from all across the u.s. audition with a unique talent.. everything from 9 year old singers to electric violinists, magic acts to rock bands, comedians to jugglers and ventriloquists, they're all here. a panel of 3 judges (david hasselhoff, brandy, and piers morgan) vote on the acts as they perform, and a negative vote from all the judges eliminates the contestant. this was changed after the first few episodes into an \"approve or disapprove\" system where the judges vote afterwards on a winner, and a majority vote from the American public decides a second winner for the round.<br /><br />first of all, the judges suck. i know they are set up like \"token\" judges from Idol, the nice one, the straightforward one, and the in-between one, but regardless of who they are, and not to belittle their specialty (acting, music etc) they don't seem unbiased when judging competitors.. it seems 3 real, normal people could do a better job. they are constantly voting for each other and pressing each other's buttons (literally), arguing over stupid things, and essentially mucking up the entire show. hasselhoff dosen't know if he's coming or going, and will approve just about anyone, brandy usually does a halfway decent job, and piers, while being the \"token\" sharp tongued, tell it like it is brit, is totally unappreciated in his time.. he might be a little abrasive, but that's his character, and he seems to be the only one that makes sense. the audience dosen't help either, every time someone comes on stage only to be told that they suck, they cry, and then get pushed into the finals anyway, so whats the point? the producers obviously included acts that are extremely un-talented, for shock value and ratings, and while some of them may very well be genuinely talented, there are acts that are better than them, and they can't seem to take someone telling them how it is.. if thats the case they should have stayed at home.<br /><br />also, people who get voted out are often brought back, and sometimes displace people who really are talented. i'm sure no one wants to see a little girl cry because she came in front of America and got told that she sucked, but does that mean she automatically gets pushed into the finals? and with so many different types of acts, the judges act somewhat obligated to mix up the finals but not including too many of one type of act.. and that's pretty biased. how exactly is this show supposed to work? maybe categories would help.<br /><br />the acts themselves are almost worth watching the show. there are some people on there who could legitimately become stars, and some who are neat to watch.. but some (that got passed into the later stages of the show) are just horrendous.. rappin granny? n'versity? how did these people even get on the show in the first place? the other thing is that a lot of the people who have been in the finals are actually professionals in the field of their \"talent\".. believe it or not, rappin' granny has appeared in several movies, and most of the acts do their \"talent\" for a living. i thought this was going to be normal, everyday people who got a shot at stardom, but apparently not so. also, a few of the bigger acts coordinate their performances with the producers, using props and gags that they otherwise wouldn't have access to, and that somewhat helps them \"outshine\" the other performers.<br /><br />bottom line, the show isn't what it wants to be.. and it's its own fault. maybe some format changes will help, but hell, i can get up onstage and cry.. maybe it will win me a million dollars. if these people can't run with the big dogs, they need to accept it and move on.. and the judges and producers need to take an UNBIASED approach, instead of one thats tailor-made for primetime ratings, yet still dosen't deliver.\n",
      "OK. I agree this show qualifies as \"guilty pleasure\". A few of the acts actually DO have talent. Many of the others have a certain brainless remedial value to watch while you do the dishes, chat on the internet or sort through your mail.<br /><br />As a serious talent search, however (like Star Search was), it's absurd! Out of the immense pool of talented people in America, this can't possibly represent the highest echelon! This show is watchable in the way The Gong Show was; a number of silly novelty acts. Yet The Gong Show didn't take itself so seriously! It didn't try to claim it had some of America's greatest talent! It didn't have judges who feign sincere commentary. Plus the acts appeared ONCE and were gone; you didn't have the same acts vying for slots in final rounds. It was simple silly fun. This show would have done better to be the same.<br /><br />This show became somewhat absurd when the judges not only venerated the RAPPING GRANNY but voted her into the finals! America's Got Talent lost all credibility with that move. \"America's Got Cheap Novelty Acts\" would be a better title.<br /><br />They shouldn't pretend to sincerely be about quality when a no-talent \"rapping granny\" is the judges' choice.<br /><br />P.S. Should I even mention that \"America's GOT Talent\" is improper English?\n",
      "I am not sure if this is a spoiler just my opinion. I find her dreadful and dramatic as a judge. Granted, the burlesque dancer should not have through to the top ten on Aug. 2 but when I saw Brandy be so rude to her I got mad. Some music videos are more sexual and I am sure Brandy has made a song or two and acted sexy on stage. Give me a Break!!!!!!! Then, I see these kids cover their eyes. Most kids watch far worse in the video games and the violence in movies they watch. This was just hypocrisy at its finest. I think Simon Cowell would have been far better bringing over X Factor to America than starting this show.... it is about real talent of all ages where a rapping Granny would never be in a grand finale.\n",
      "I've never seen a more obviously stupid TV show that insults the viewers intelligence more than this one. (But there are probably a lot of contenders out there.) The judges are hams, led by Mr. Cheese Fest himself David Hasselhoff, and rounded out by everyone's favorite biyach - Sharon Osborne. The British judge is another nobody, and the black stage hand gives out the oldest and worst reused one liners in comedic lore. \"This is crazytown and that guy's the mayor.\" AAAAARRRRRRRRRRGGGHHHHHHHHHH!!!!! Obviously the really bad contestants are placements or fillers. Nobody is that stupid to believe these lame acts are serious. (Or are there wrestling fans out there?) There is some talent in the mix of stupid acts and serious acts no doubt, but wading through the imbeciles is not my idea of entertainment. It's insulting to think that the producers actually believe that the audience falls for this.<br /><br />I saw all of this in the 70's with The Gong Show which was fresher and funnier. This remake gets a 1 out of 10. I got up to write this review after the first 10 minutes of the July 7th show and I'll never watch this show again. Skip this if you have a higher IQ than a fern. Fans - you're a bunch of morons.\n",
      "The worse thing about the show has already been duly noted by some of my fellow reviewers: the so-called judges.<br /><br />There should be a rule, effective immediately (which means by next Wednesday), that each 'judge' cannot hit the other two 'judges' buzzers; they can hit only their own. This is a no-brainer, I mean it's obviously not fair to the contestants that the British guy (the most offensive of the three), say, can hit Brandy's buzzer if HE's decided the currently-performing act is not worthy of any further consideration. And Brandy did the same thing, when the Snow White contestant was stripping on this week's show - she found it offensive and she buzzed in and then proceeded to try desperately to hit Hasselhoff's and the British guy's buzzers, until she finally succeeded. She was still outnumbered, and Snow White's coming back, but that's not the point. This behavior is childish, rude and pathetic beyond comprehension and should not be tolerated.<br /><br />That being said, the show is OK, I guess. It ain't IDOL, it's more like The Gong Show revisited (as another reviewer mentioned), with Regis thrown in for semi-credibility. Some of the contestants have been good, and one in particular has been fantastic: the 11-year-old Bianca Ryan (I think that's her name - we'll be hearing it again, undeniably), who belted out And I'm Telling You like nobody's business. I really liked how she changed the lyrics to make the song more appropriate for someone her age: instead of singing \"you're the best man I've ever known,\" she changed it to \"you're the best friend\", which I thought was very classy and smart, making her rendition more than just a young kid trying to sing about things she couldn't possibly know about. Brilliant performer, can't wait to see her again.<br /><br />8/2/08: So now we're already in the third season, with Brandy having been replaced by Sharon Osbourne - a major improvement - and Jerry Springer replacing Regis (not so much). Bianca Ryan went on to win Season One, which was fantastic, and last year, the person who deserved to win also took it, ventriloquist Terry Fater. This year, the auditions have finally been completed, and there are a couple of stand-outs, both female singers. Should be worth tuning in for, unless Gordon Ramsay is on a drunken rampage on the other channel.<br /><br />8/7/08: It was absolutely shameless and cruel last night, the way the judges handled the choosing of the 40 finalists, particularly Hasselhoff, with vocalist Queen Emily - taking advantage of her overly-emotional nature, putting her through the torture of \"we don't want to break hearts,\" blah blah blah, when we all knew damn well she was going through. And Sharon has sunk to the bottom of the heap as well, giving at least 3 contestants a sad speech about how she couldn't stand doing this, yadda yadda yadda, with all 3 going through, of course. In fact, with two of them, she was actually shaking her head NO before saying yes. Blatantly offensive, the whole affair.\n",
      "Are we finally about done with this reality show BS? I know they are incredibly cheap to produce and don't require much in talent salaries or any writer salaries to speak of, but at what cost? Have we really become what the movie \"Idiocracy\" predicts for American culture? This show is the absolute bottom of the barrel. It is television at its lowest point ever. Remember when NBC aired shows like \"Hill Street Blues,\" \"Cheers,\" \"St. Elsewhere,\" \"Night Court,\" \"The Cosby Show,\" \"Seinfeld,\" etc? Many of those shows would appear on the same night! What the Hell happened to network programming since then? We did.<br /><br />Well, tastes change but the people who complain about TV content don't. It's hard to put a real drama or comedy that suits modern sensibilities on TV anymore. If you do something real, adult and intelligent it either turns off short attention-spanned teens or offends the Christian Right who literally comprise 99 percent of all complaints about content on network TV (true, look that up).<br /><br />Cable, Tivo and the internet are making it increasingly less lucrative to advertise on TV. That means ad rates have gone down. That means TV shows have to be made for less money. And that means networks will put on the cheapest poop they can get away with and still sell soap in the mid-west. And of course, that means \"America's Got Talent\" season two.<br /><br />So, if you're tired of this worthless \"reality TV\" crap and you want a truly funny sitcom or an intelligent, engrossing drama that addresses relevant issues of today, either get HBO or complain to the Parents Television Council and tell them to stop complaining every time something interesting happens on TV. Next, contact your local affiliates and ask them to pass on the word to the network that you're willing to sit through commercials if they'll just start paying actors and writers to make real TV again.<br /><br />There, I'm done. Just thought it needed to be said.\n",
      "First of all, the judges on the show really lower its quality. They never seem to know what they are talking about, they judge the acts on entertainment value rather than talent, and they are all biased and opinionated. Hasselhoff seems a little weird these days, Brandy has nothing to say at all, and Piers is just some guy with, as far as I can see, no real credentials. The show should be called \"America's Got Stupid Entertainers.\" It doesn't live up to its title. In fact, one of the judges' favorite acts was the \"rapping granny,\" who was only mildly entertaining and hardly talented at all. The caliber of entertainers on the show is rather low; most of the acts are very amateurish. Regis doesn't really make the show any better. He doesn't do much of anything. He must be asking himself how he got himself into this at all. America has Talent, but you won't see it on this show. At this point, I feel that no one in the competition is deserving of the million dollar prize. This show stresses me out.\n",
      "The Judges make this show horrible and I will not be watching in the future. The one judge x's everybody before they start and then when the other two don't because they want to give the talent at least a chance to perform, he reaches over and x's their buttons for them stopping the talent. He is a joke and needs to be muzzled or this show will not be successful!!! Also why do they X talent and then still send them through?? Do they have a clue??? The judges think people tune in to watch them. No we tune in because we want to see the talent good or bad. Take the x buttons away from them, they don't know how to appropriately use them and the show is very aggravating to watch because of it.\n",
      "I was disappointed and disgusted with Peirs Morgans comments to the Celtic dancers. It was totally inappropriate on national television (prime time, no less) to suggest(?) that the family drop mom & dad from the act. It almost sounded like blackmail...they not only could win the competition this night, but very possibly win the million dollars but only if they got rid of mom and dad. Family values? Then to top it off, to encourage a stripper (with all the sexual innuendos) during a prime time television show in my opinion is not family entertainment. Could NBC be risking a \"Janet Jackson\" faux paus with this behavior? Brandi is right...a stripper has no place on prime time TV. In my opinion Peirs Morgan needs to receive an \"X\" (or the axe)!\n",
      "OK, I saw this movie at the tribeca film festival and came face to face with the director as I tried to get the hell out of there. I wish I could have said this to him now.<br /><br />the guy must have a vendetta against the female race or something because the young (18 years old!!!) female lead Reina seems to be everything he wants you to hate about women. She is a cock tease, she uses her sexuality to get men to do things for her (quel horreur!), she cares about only one thing, coming to America to find her drug addicted mess of a mother and have a better life. Throughout the movies, she is robbed, raped, crosses the rio grande, is stuffed in a hollowed out tree stump and abandoned by her boyfriend in a skanky hostel in brooklyn. She is such a pathetic figure in the end of the movie, how could anyone possibly look this young messed up mother of an infant, prostitute and caretaker of a indigent mother in the eye and tell her to kill herself? well, thats what the director/writer and lead character does. what a mensch.<br /><br />which leads me to the male \"hero\". although attractive in the face, he has the personality of Nomie Malone from Showgirls, and I have trouble believing all women fall for his charms. He continually gets himself lost by running around like a person who's never lived in a big city, I have a hard time swallowing that a colombian from medellin is that ignorant of neighborhoods and how to retrace their steps, that city has 3 million people in it. I've met colombians, they seem to do just fine with streets and landmarks, they even know how to drive!!!! They are a sophisticated and street savvy people. Even worse, he often stumbles into NYC landscapes that are right out of 80s movies clichés (trash can fire bums, squatters, s&m, payphones - your movie needs to be updated when it looks like a scene from bonfire of the vanities) This is not NYC, this is NYC circa 1988,<br /><br />there's so much \"ick\" factor in this movie, there's even a sex scene with a sleeping grandma in the room. A SLEEPING GRANDMA PEOPLE!! Thats farrelly brothers gross, and not in a good way.<br /><br />With a plot so similar to Showgirls its spooky, this movie is simply really really really bad.\n",
      "It was surprising, at least after all the media attention in Latin circles it received, to come out of this movie as if I had just lost 2 hours of my time. If anything after having seen Mexican and Colombian cinema and being familiarized with the themes they depict, \"Paraiso\" doesn't seem to know where it wants to go and what subjects it really wants us to familiarize ourselves with. The theme of illegal immigration, a hot topic these days, has received plenty of attention from many media outlets, even film. Pick any Mexican or Colombian film from the last decade and the idea of an \"Better American hope of life\", is soon to be found, however, \"Paraiso\" fails at showing us what really motivates these characters or what lies behind their intentions. Possibly, poor acting has something to do with that, hiring non-actors from some of these roles was a huge mistake by Mr. Brand, who could learn plenty from his Mexican and Spanish counterparts, he lacks the experience to be able to take a mediocre script and really bring a believable and manageable story within the confines of the Spanish language. Hopefully Latin-American cinema has a little more to offer than this.\n",
      "I love all things Irish and was in hopes this would be a clever movie about an enduring Irish Legend. Instead I saw another version of \"Cruella DeVille\" acting out an improbable (even for a fantasy) story. The actor who played the leprechaun was good but the rest of the cast seemed to be along for the ride. When the film ended the only feeling you had was \"why did I waste my time?\"\n",
      "This is one of the most vapid, poorly acted movies I have seen in years. I had to force myself to sit through the entire thing, and was quite proud when I made it to the end. . . though saddened by the fact that I had lost that chunk of my life to this travesty. My daughter who is 6 (and God knows the movie tastes of 6 year old girls runs pretty parallel to this dribble)could not even stay awake through it, and it is probably the first movie ever she had no desire to watch again. Yes, that's right, a 6 year old girl refused to sit through this movie a second time. In her words \"it was stupid\". I think that pretty much sums up this colossal waste of time, and film. It was stupid.\n",
      "Unlike Jumanji, this is NOT for anyone smarter than a 5th grader. They use typical kid shortcomings instead of writing a clever script. Much of the story didn't make sense or was simply unbelievable. They seem to just make stuff up to fit what they wanted - some things floated in space including the sputum and the astronaut, but the kids were totally unaffected by 0 gravity. The guy stuck in the game, the Zorgons we never see, the robot repairing itself forever, all seemed like lazy writing and directing. The youngest kid screws up constantly and says I'm sorry at least 40 times. I was so sick of this needy, whiny child that I didn't care if they made it home or not. I'm sure there are parents who don't know how to discipline their kids so some will find this believable. Those who feel parents should address rude and co-dependent behavior early, will lose patience with this mess of a movie driven by redundant bad behavior.\n",
      "This movie will appeal to the six year olds...and hopefully not to much older.... It was simply a terrible piece of work that went downhill from the opening. If you liked Jimunji, then just watch it again rather than ruin your self with this dreadful film. There is no decent exchange between characters...the set is BORING! Some of the writing for this was so trite and contrived that I thought I would gag!! I was very glad to have it end and even happier to return it ...the same day! The two young actors were poorly directed as well. Tim Robbins is in this for the first five minutes and about the last five minutes....I'm sure he got a decent paycheck but his acting looked flat and as ridiculous as the rest of this thing. If you enjoy watching two young brothers shouting at each other over and over and over again then this may be for you!!\n",
      "....would have made a better show. Even in Black and White. Scrpter David Koepp may well have been brought aboard to pad this piece, which i saw in a theater in Atlanta, GA last night - for free! (An ARMED guy hired by Sony informed us that anyone caught copying the flick would be 'escorted from the premises'.... but WHO would want to copy this?) . . . . the audience was really well mixed and received the movie warmly. I thought the movie played too hard to the ten-year-old 'cussy-boy' crowd, who seemed after wards to be a bit embarrassed by it all, as were many of the parents whose eye I caught exiting the theater while the end credits rolled. Not a soul screamed at the reptilian, rubber monster that terrorized the six-year old (precocious, as usual); some of the sight gags were not fully developed (why was the bike falling out of the sky so pertinent? We never found out whose it was!); the teen girl feature was posed for the daddies in the theater. The LANGUAGE was a problem for me and will be for Evangelical Christians on out to your huge crowd small-town moralists; \"Dick\"; \"Ass\"; \"God\" and \"O God....\". Which begs the question: \"Who is this movie for?\" Take another look at Joe Johnston's work to see how a director creates for a wider audience. Hids \"Jumanji\" doesn't feel padded as \"Zathura\" does. The filmmakers could have gone for the PG-13 while they were at it, for the Fox \"Malcom in the Middle\" crowd. But I think that crowd is too small; look at your TV viewing demographic.... yes, this movie just misses being family fare. I hope I am right....\n",
      "I'll give them point for good special effects and nice production values. I'll even spot them a point because someone who had never seen Jumanji would find much of Zathura new and exciting.<br /><br />OK, those are my 3 points in my rating.<br /><br />The bickering interaction between the siblings was realistic enough I got to use it as an example to my kids, afterward. I'm not giving it a point because it was irritating enough to get really old.<br /><br />How in the ***** *********!!! can the makers have varied SO incomprehensibly little from Jumanji? Even a sequel needs SOME variety! The Robot (which, by the way, looked pretty cool - I want one) was a dead rip off of Van Pelt. The meteor shower was a dead ripoff of the monsoon. Etc.<br /><br />I'm glad I found it on TV instead of renting it... I certainly would have been finding a way to drop another point off my rating.<br /><br />Never seen Jumanji? Sure... watch this. Have? I'm amazed anyone could have put this out on the market.\n",
      "When i rented the DVD, the story and pictures on the cover seemed fun, but when i got to the middle of the movie i almost fell asleep. The movie confuses it's watcher so much that it brings him to a point that he cannot understand who are the good guys and who are the bad. The hero doesn't knows who to trust, too much talking and hardly no action.. The movie has a few humoristic moments, some action here and there but no more..<br /><br />You can surely skip it...\n",
      "Double Take is a film that makes you wonder how a pretty good premise like \"Across the Bridge\" (1957) can be turned into such a convoluted piece of... (anyway a very bad movie).<br /><br />There really is no way to descibe or spoil the movie because the plot is such a mess. For example here is a plot summary--> there is a good guy (Orlando Jones) and a bad guy (Eddie Griffin) who has a dog that hates the good guy, but then the good guy is framed (by apparently the bad guys using what is called a \"Double Take\", but was he really framed by the good guys imitating the bad guys? So, then the bad guy (Griffin) changes places with the good guy (Jones). Only to have (Jones become a bad guy in another country where the now good-bad-guy (Griffin) killed a really bad guy and stole his dog for evidence (only no wait, he didn't really kill him either (probably another double take, i dont remember who really killed him, I think it was a bad guy).<br /><br />So then wait, Jones apparently had a child with someone so that they could pull a \" double take\" on the real bad guys, only Griffin is still bad and the U.S. cops are bad, but the undercover cops are good, but the undercover mofia as undercover cops are bad, and eventually the head moffia boss guy is also good, but only until he is bad again.<br /><br />And then.....<br /><br />Well, if you made it this far and really want to know, watch the movie.<br /><br />It has a few nice points (mainly around a beginning that references The Godfather (look for oranges, which signify death). The bit about \"Slitz malt liquor is good too).<br /><br />But that is about it, a few good quotes does not a good movie make and Double Take gives you the fealing of, \"Heah, maybe I can throw a good idea (or a zillion) at you\". One of them has got to stick.<br /><br />The problem is that with so many ideas and concepts and bads and goods, and mechanical pen gismos used to call in the national guard, Double Take ain't kepn it Real. It sure isn't representing the original 1957 movie idea.<br /><br />Viewed in theatres (35mm) Rated:1\n",
      "Frenetic, silly and a waste of time. This movie has nothing to recommend it. Clearly, someone had some extra money and time and decided that it would be charitable to give some B-movie actors some work. The result is a perfectly forgettable effort.<br /><br />The plot is most convoluted mix of relationships, back-stabbings and shootings imaginable. It's like a RoadRunner cartoon. Remember those? The endings were always predictable. The same is true of this movie. There is absolutely nothing to make it interesting.<br /><br />If you have any other way of spending 90 minutes then don't choose this movie. I suggest either studying your navel or thumb twiddling. Both are more exciting.\n",
      "Hey, this film was awful. I mean, there are bad films that are so terrible they are fun to watch. But this one just goes waaay beyond imagination. There was no way I could bear till the credits rolled and I had to give up around 55 mins into the story at the junkyard scene.<br /><br />The plot is like it was written in a kindergarten for the mentally disadvantaged. Plot holes of the size even an ocean liner would sink in them.<br /><br />Mr Griffin is the unfunniest, most annoying wannabe ever giving a try on comedy.<br /><br />Be warned and avoid at any cost. I would like to ask the guys who scored this garbage 10 what were they able to like in this - er, okay, I just would not want to call this a movie - so in this complete waste of efforts ?<br /><br />Though the cutting could have saved the film, but then the musters should have been cut lengthwise.\n",
      "This is very easily in contention for the worst movie ever. Painful to watch. I was tempted to get up and leave the theater as I endured the pain. The only thing that kept me in the theater was I was there with three friends. Later when we got out of the theater we all commented that the movie was completely bad and that we should have walked out on it.\n",
      "Though billed as a Rush Hour action-comedy, it is not funny at all, except for one scene at the end. Even though the actors were good, this movie is not recommended from me. It could have had funnier moments. My rating: 4/10\n",
      "Do not be fooled. This movie is terrible. It looks like a humorous situational comedy involving two men who need to change places to evade the police. It is not. The movie stumbles between a horrible crime who done it and cheep slapstick comedy. The movie's main fault lies in that no scene lasts for more than twenty seconds, and as a result does not allow for any jokes. This is a comedy with out jokes. If you take jokes away from a comedy your left with nothing, no plot, no characters, no entertainment. Nothing. Do not watch this movie under any circumstances. If someone tries tells you this is a good movie hit them with a pointed stick and say, NO! If you watch this understand what you're getting into and don't say I didn't warn you.\n",
      "This movie was plagued by overall mediocrity. While parts of it were funny, many jokes were so bad that you question the movie being called a comedy. In terms of plot, there are many insignificant twists to the point where you don't even concern yourself with following the story, only to see what happens at the end. Not worth watching.\n",
      "It's not too often that I really want to see a particular movie. But this was one of those exceptions. The trailers were pretty funny, and I figured if they were just a small segment of what the rest of the movie is like... it should be hilarious. Well, I think they used the funniest parts of the movie to put in those trailers. It seems like the movie is focused just as much on action and plot as it is humor (which I didn't really expect since the trailer portrayed it as mostly comedy). The only problem with that is the movie is so complicated and twisted that I lost interest in its story early on. The movie could have been redeemed if it had great action sequences. But it doesn't. The movie could have been redeemed if it were fall-on-the-floor funny. But it isn't.<br /><br />The story is the number one problem. There are too many twists and turns. In some movies that can add some suspense and mystery. But in this movie, it just fails. And I think it's because the movie tries to be too much. It tries too hard to be a great action film, a comedy, and a twisted mystery-esque flick (I'm not sure what you could call it). Had it placed all its energy in one or even two of those... I think it could have been much better.<br /><br />And to top it off... I don't think there is much comedic chemistry between Jones and Griffin. The trailers look promising in that area too, but again, the movie falls short.\n",
      "Let's start off by saying that i didn't expect much from this picture. A guy I don't really know from work told me it was funny. It was playing at the 4 dollar theater and I had about 2 hours to kill. It was actually was worse than I expected it to be and I was expecting low, really low, but seriously I wanted to walk out. However I was only there to kill time so I sat through every last painful second. First thing is, and you get this from the opening scene, that this can't just be a comedy.No, it feels a need to falsely become something greater than that by trying to portray some kind of racy cop flick. The kind of movie where everybody is in the FBI but nobody's doing much of anything. The terrible thing is that they really expect you to go along with it.<br /><br />If this flim-flam plotline wasn't enough you've got Eddie Griffin, a black comedian who expects you to laugh just because of the fact that he's black.<br /><br />He's black! He's loud! He's....a terrible stereotype jammed into a two dimensional character. For those of you that thought Spike Lee was too far-fetched in Bamboozled take a look at this movie and see that our society is not far off from a new millenium minstrel show,it's pretty much right here only in different form. Of course you've also got your most recent up to date humor that won't last even five years. ie \" Do I look like Puffy?!\" when people forget about Puffy they won't know what the hell this quote means,but if people are smart enough they will let this film and others like it just fade away. Orlando Jones actually shows some potential in acting and in some comedy. However, something tells me that he won't be bold enough to take a challenging role anytime soon. Overall this was extremely painful for me to watch. Maybe I should be happy that comedies featuring black leads are no longer trying to copy 'FRIDAY'(a great film,in my opinion) yet still they're gonna have to try harder than this.\n",
      "(sigh) Double Team is another useless action comedy. This movie didn´t have a theatrical run in Finland and I don´t wonder. You can see one this kind of movies made straight to video. Orlando Jones has been much better in other movies. The movie wasn´t funny, except one scene. Total waste of time. (3 points out of 10, *½ out of *****)\n",
      "Hi, I saw Double Take. It was complete and utter garbage. I was so sick to my stomach and was mad that i wasted money on it. It was completely stupid with an impossible plot to follow, and the only parts that were funny had been extremely over used in the commercials. I dont want a yardburger, cult 45, or to ever see that that godless sick twisted movie ever agian.\n",
      "Did they honestly think that this movie would be good? Did the really think people would like it so much that they'd tell their friends to go see it, and then buy it when released on DVD?<br /><br />I think the people involved with this movie must think you can get away with a loose script and bad comedy as long as it's got lots of explosions and sexy women.\n",
      "First of all, this is an incredible bad film. Before I saw it, I to believed that anything Fassbinder touched would turn out to be pure works of genius. You are reading the comments of a very disillusioned man. Kamikaze -89 is ugly, stupid and impossible to take seriously. It shoots at a million different directions, but fails to hit anything but its own feet. After 100 minutes in the company of Kamikaze -89, my brain started hurting.<br /><br />That said, it's not a complete waste of time. Seeing a pi***ed, drunk out of his mind, Fassbinder strousing around in leopard outfit, like a wounded walrus, DOES have its perverse charm. In fact, seeing Fassbinder and some of his regulars degrade themselves in this totally psychotronic film is the only thing that makes it somewhat worthwhile.<br /><br />The story takes place in the near future... 1989 to be specific. Everybody wears the ugliest new wave outfits on this side of Culture Club and Germany has become the most advanced and powerful country in the world. All social and political problems have been solved and everybody is happy. Or so it seems. The state of Germany have but one enemy, a person or organization called Krystopompas (!), who believes that the people of Germany has become pacified and dehumanized by the regime. He starts giving bomb threats, and the state of Germany puts their best man on the case, police lieutenant Jansen (Fassbinder in a leopard suite). Then a lot of nonsense takes place. People start pointing fingers at Jansen, yelling \"Krystopompas!\" for no apparent reason. Jansen goes to a strip-joint where everybody is laughing hysterically for no apparent reason. Lots of other nonsense follows. And then the film takes some awful 1984-inspired turns and mysterious conspiracies like \"The blue panther\", \"unexpected deaths\" and \"the 31st Floor\" become visible. Needless to say, Fassbinder somehow cracks the case and then he screws a picture of an astronaut. The end.<br /><br />A must-see!<br /><br />\n",
      "I'm sorry to say that, but i can hardly say it's a good film... The cinematography is dull, the photography is so cheapo that you could think you're in a \"Derrick\" episode. The scenario losses some parts during the timeline... Even the music (composed by the professional Edgar Froese) is - uhm... Outdated? No 80s revival will save this film from the brink of extinction. The only advantage for its producers is that you CAN'T forget it after a vision. Uhmm... Not for the good, i'm afraid..\n",
      "This must be one of the worst films I have ever seen! There is no beginning, no story, and no end! What on earth went through Nicole Heesters mind when she accepted that part, is beyond me. An otherwise brilliant actress has her biggest - an until now only - genuine fiasco.<br /><br />If it shows anything, it's the mess in Fassbinders mind near the end of his life. So many cliché's, I'm surprised I watched it 'till the end. I suppose that's because of the clothes, which is an interesting study of the extremes of the time. I suppose you could also see inspector Jansen as a parody, which might make it a bit more bearable, but the storyline is still too thin to make it worth while.\n",
      "Just saw this movie and the main selling point was Malkovich in the cast. He was fine, as was the female lead played by Evangeline Lilly. The main thing that did this movie in for me was a rather leaden performance from Romain Duris. The basic plot is that Malkovich is a \"messenger\" or someone who can foretell people's deaths. He is also a doctor working with dying people. He contacts Duris and, for the greater part of the movie, the audience is lead to believe that Duris is destined to die. Needless to say, this isn't the way the movie plays out. The director (or writer) manages to establish a dull, plodding rhythm to the film which is confusing and distracting. No more info for anyone interested in seeing the film and the film is worth a rental, if only to watch and revel in another quirky performance from Malkovich and a great performance from Evangeline Lilly. The main problem is it's difficult to empathize, sympathize or otherwise ize with Duris who has the emotional range of a rock in this film.\n",
      "License To Kill (1989) is an inanely dismal installment to the Bond franchise that is best forgotten. It stars Timothy Dalton in his second and final performance. After aiding old time friend and FBI man, Felix Leiter (David Hedison) in a drug bust, and standing up for Felix at his wedding, Bond returns hours later to discover Felix's wife is dead and that Felix is barely clinging to life after being fed to a shark. Seems drug lord, Franz Sanchez (Robert Davi) was none too thrilled about Bond and Leiter's bust. From his posh villa in Mexico, Sanchez is perfectly content to let bygones be bygones. But Bond wants revenge. <br /><br />Told to drop things by his superiors, Bond defies the British government, is stripped of his double-o ranking and embarks upon a campaign of revenge. To this end he seems perfectly in tune with the aspirations of Pam Bouvier (Carey Lowell), an undercover FBI agent assigned to pick up where Felix left off. Together, Bond and Bouvier prowl the back streets of Mexico City, doing battle with Sanchez's psychotic henchman, Dario (a very young, Benicio Del Toro) while Bond attempts to bleed Sanchez maul, Lupe Lamore (Talisa Soto) for information.<br /><br />What is particularly disappointing about this film is the sudden absence of fundamental elements that we have come to expect from a Bond movie; scantily clad women, witty one liners, memorable action sequences  and above all else  a certain amount of seriousness on the part of the actors to suspend the audience in the art of make believe. But there is nothing even remotely engaging about a misguided vignette that has Wayne Newton cast as a charlatan leader of a religious cult. Nor is there anything memorable about the brief moments of action that round out an otherwise boring movie in which the bulk of the plot concentrates on Sanchez  sneering and plotting while other men with guns shoot it out with Bond and Bouvier.<br /><br />MGM/UA's DVD is the absolute worst transfer of any of the Bond movies. Riddled in aliasing, pixelization, shimmering of fine details and severe edge enhancement, the video is never stable long enough to appreciate the story  such as it is. Colors are dated with overly pink flesh tones, weak contrast levels and a generally gritty digital that is distracting to say the least. Blacks are more deep gray, whites are either blooming or dull and age related artifacts are quite obvious throughout  much more so than expected for a film of this vintage. The audio is stereo surround, but is generally strident and lacking in bass. Extras include two documentaries, audio commentaries, promotional materials and the film's theatrical trailer.\n",
      "I love watching a James Bond. It's not very intellectual, granted, but it's fun. I know the basic difference between each James Bond are the bad guy, the girl and the bad guy's HQ which always blows up at the end(don't tell me this is a spoiler). But in this, the producers had a new idea for James Bond: he will be on a personal vendetta... The idea was bad and so is the final product. Timothy Dalton is terrible. He was okay in \"The Living Daylights\" but this time, he is just awful. Everything about his Bond is wrong. He tries to be like Sean Connery, but never comes close to the Great One. I will add that the bad guy is just a crazy maniac that kills everyone in \"original\" ways. Bad, bad, bad... In fact, it is the worse James Bond, for now.<br /><br />If you want to see a James Bond today, don't watch this one. 4/10...\n",
      "I can't decide what was the worst thing about this movie. The bad plot, terrible acting, cheesy 1970's Barnaby Jones sets, lack of Bond gadgets, lack of Bond sex, silly Spanish accents or defeating a a guy with a gun to his head by throwing a couple of maggots in his face. The maggots reminded me of what happened when Lieutenant Frank Dreben (Naked Gun) had a pillow thrown at his face, except they were serious about it in this movie! An FBI agent they want dead is fed to a shark, but pulled back up before dead, put into a bag and left back at home to die? ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! That's the same schtick as the \"unnecessarily slow dipping mechanism\" gag in Austin Powers, except it was a joke in Austin Powers! This piece of crap has nothing to do with Bond. They just slapped the name on to a bad idea and out into the world it went. I didn't realize this was included in the collector's pack of 7 DVDs. I tried to watch it once, but had to shut it off after an hour. Save yourself the pain.....throw it away now!\n",
      "UGH... As an adorer of the James Bond character, I have to call Timothy Dalton a sacrilege! And apparently, this movie was his satanic shrine. YUCK! This film has nothing of the appeal of the great old bond films nor any of the thrills of the new ones. It was nothing but scene upon scene of 80's superficiality with nothing underneath. There were none of the fantastically witty Bond lines nor of his legendary charm. Dalton drained him completely. And what was with that horrible wedding scene?? It was like a bad remake of The Godfather. Really, I couldn't stomach the thing, it was all just too awful. As for those who credit this as being a great Bond film because of its likeness to Ian Flemings work... so what? If you want to read the book, go to the library. This is a fictional movie and one that, in my opinion, could have been done A LOT better.\n",
      "I do firmly believe that the revue on this film is highly unfair. The \"If You like this try...\" says it all. The recommendation is \"Requiem for a Dream\". It is most certainly not one of the best movies I have seen, but as the angst ridden road movie it is, it is highly watchable. At the time it premiered it was widely discussed due to it's sexual and to some degree violent sexual content. It is a spiraling vortex down to an unavoidable end. Capturing some of the counter culture of the time, wanting to escape Your surroundings, Your situation of Scandinavia, it gives prof that You can leave but never escape Yourself. If You want shine happy people, stay clear away from this one. This end of the 80's piece is as dark as it got back then.\n"
